## Abstract

We present a mechanistic interpretability analysis of the linguistic reasoning circuit in Gemma-2-2B, examining how the model implements antonym/synonym retrieval, morphological inflection (pluralisation and past-tense formation), and lexical definition look-up. Using Neuronpedia attribution graphs and sparse autoencoder (SAE) feature analysis, we generated and analysed 10 attribution graphs across four metalinguistic sub-tasks. Cross-graph feature mining at a 50% recurrence threshold identified 312 recurring circuit components, of which 15 were labelled via the Neuronpedia explanation API. The most universal recurring feature — Layer 6, Feature 2586668 (node_id=6_2267_3; "*words that appear in programming code, legal jargon, or scientific texts*") — appeared 37 times across 10 graphs, present in every prompt. The dominant causal architecture consists of a direct embedding→logit excitatory path (weights ranging from 9.79 to 14.14) that carries the majority of the output signal in a single hop, supported by secondary multi-hop paths. Four of ten prompts showed all causal paths converging through an unlabeled Layer 24 bottleneck node with a strong negative final edge, functioning as a competitor-suppression gate. Prediction confidence ranged from p=0.344 ("written," past tense of "write") to p=0.836 ("author"), inversely correlated with morphological irregularity. Notably, the prompt with the lowest confidence ("swam") activated a "*baseball terminology*" feature (Layer 5, Feature 10444) as its highest-influence early-layer detector — a compelling example of polysemantic feature repurposing for morphological computation.

## 1. Introduction

Mechanistic interpretability research aims to understand how large language models implement specific cognitive operations at the level of individual features and circuits. Linguistic reasoning — operations such as antonym retrieval, morphological transformations (pluralisation, tense change), and definitional look-up — provides an ideal testbed because the correct output is unambiguous, yet the computation required spans multiple levels of linguistic knowledge.

In this paper we analyse the shared circuit that Gemma-2-2B (2 billion parameters) uses to answer ten metalinguistic prompts drawn from four sub-categories: antonym/synonym retrieval, morphological inflection, and lexical look-up. Using the Neuronpedia attribution graph API, we generate sparse attribution graphs for each prompt and apply cross-graph feature mining to identify the features that recur across all or most prompts — the putative "linguistic reasoning circuit." We then trace causal paths from these features to the final logit node, producing both quantitative edge-weight data and mechanistic narratives for each prompt.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Model and Prompts

We use the Gemma-2-2B model with the Gemmascope Transcoder 16K sparse autoencoder (SAE), accessed via the Neuronpedia API. Ten prompts were selected to span four metalinguistic operations:

- **Antonym/synonym retrieval:** "The opposite of hot is", "The antonym of ancient is", "A synonym for happy is", "Another word for fast is"
- **Plural morphology:** "The plural of child is", "The plural of mouse is"
- **Past tense morphology:** "The past tense of swim is", "The past tense of write is"
- **Lexical look-up:** "A book of maps is called an", "A person who writes books is called an"

All prompts end mid-sentence so the next predicted token is unambiguous. This design ensures that the attribution graph captures the computation for a single well-defined answer.

### 2.2 Attribution Graph Generation

Attribution graphs were generated via the Neuronpedia `/api/graph/generate` endpoint with the following parameters:
- `maxFeatureNodes`: 3000
- `desiredLogitProb`: 0.95
- `nodeThreshold`: 0.8
- `edgeThreshold`: 0.85

Each graph node represents a SAE feature at a specific transformer layer and token context position. Each directed edge carries a weight indicating how strongly the source feature causally influences the target feature's activation.

### 2.3 Cross-Graph Analysis

We applied `compare_graphs()` with a 50% threshold (minimum 5/10 graphs) to identify features constituting the shared linguistic reasoning circuit. At this threshold, 312 recurring features were identified. The top 15 were labelled via the Neuronpedia feature explanation API.

### 2.4 Causal Path Tracing

For each prompt, `trace_causal_paths()` was used to identify the strongest edge-weight chains from influential feature nodes to the final logit node. Paths were classified as excitatory (+), inhibitory (−), or mixed (±). Causal path diagrams were generated with `visualize_causal_paths()` and embedded inline in each per-prompt section.

### 3.2 Edge Neighbourhood Analysis (Top 2 Features by Average Influence)

**Top 2 recurring features ranked by avg_influence:**

**Feature 18693554 at Layer 0 (node_id=0_6113_1, avg_inf=0.7848)**
- Receives input from: embedding node E_651_1 (weight=+6.68), embedding node E_2_0 (weight=+0.29)
- Sends to: Layer 7 Feature 110677 node 7_462_1 (+0.206), Layer 5 Feature 7993995 node 5_3992_1 (+0.190), Layer 7 Feature 16528367 node 7_5741_1 (+0.161), Layer 27 (logit-proximal) Feature 7033 node 27_7033_5 (−0.017)
- Interpretation: This is a direct embedding-driven feature that projects early input representations upward through Layers 5 and 7 simultaneously, making it a parallel signal broadcaster to mid-layer processing.

**Feature 80589 at Layer 11 (node_id=11_389_1, avg_inf=0.7837)**
- Receives from: Layer 10 Feature 74951635 (−19.97), Layer 10 Feature 25329392 (+17.50), Layer 10 Feature 23225509 (+8.21), Layer 9 Feature 38548580 (+7.82), Layer 9 Feature 3843368 (+7.62), and five more Layer 9–10 nodes
- Sends to: Layer 15 Feature 294512 (−4.52), Layer 14 Feature 127672195 (−4.24), Layer 15 Feature 376262 (−3.87), Layer 12 Feature 6835740 (−3.33), Layer 17 Feature 38733183 (−3.22), and five more downstream features — ALL with negative weights
- Interpretation: Feature 80589 at Layer 11 is a **pure inhibitory hub**. It integrates conflicting signals from Layer 9–10 (positive and negative), then broadcasts inhibitory signals to Layers 12–17. This is the circuit's primary suppression gate — it systematically constrains downstream late-layer processing, likely suppressing non-target answer tokens.

### 3.3 Layer 0 Analysis

Layer 0 contains 224 nodes in the representative graph (prompt 1), with influence values ranging from 0.40 to 0.80. The top influence values (0.79–0.80) indicate that a large fraction of Layer 0 nodes are highly active, suggesting that the input-layer representation is both dense and broadly distributed. Layer 0 features lack `clerp` (token-level) labels, indicating they represent abstract input statistics rather than specific tokens. The concentration of 8/15 top recurring features at Layer 0 reflects its role as the foundation of the shared linguistic circuit — the model's initial parsing of metalinguistic prompt structure happens universally across all 10 tasks.

**Mechanistic Narrative**

**Early layers (0–3): structural template parsing.** The circuit opens not with a semantic understanding of "opposite" but with a cascade of structural detectors. Layer 2, Feature 15200 (node_id=2_15200_5, inf=0.800) — "the verb 'to be' in various languages and tenses" — fires strongly on the copula structure of the prompt. Layer 0, Feature 15944 (node_id=0_15944_5, inf=0.796) — "sentences that are questions or statements about math using 'is'" — registers this as an X-is-Y completion frame. Crucially, Layer 2, Feature 8212 (node_id=2_8212_2, inf=0.795) — "words that could be used to compare and contrast different approaches" — is already detecting the oppositional frame before any semantic content has been processed. The model at this stage knows: *this is a structured predicate-completion task asking for a contrasting term*.

**Middle layers (4–7): antonym circuit activation.** The key relational computation happens at Layer 4–7. Layer 4, Feature 10015 (node_id=4_10015_5, inf=0.800) — "words associated with the etymology or definition of a word" — switches the circuit into lexical-definition mode. Layer 4, Feature 13985 (node_id=4_13985_3, inf=0.792) — "instances of 'meant by' or 'mean by'" — further specifies that the model is computing a definitional relation. The pivotal domain-mapping moment arrives at Layer 7, Feature 4526 (node_id=7_4526_5, inf=0.797) — "words related to comparisons, symmetry or reversals in data or situations". This feature carries the highest activation in the middle band (act=5.92) and represents the exact semantic operation required: reversal. It is this feature that maps the input concept "hot" to its antonym slot.

**Late layers (8–13): signal convergence and suppression gating.** Layer 11 Feature 389 (node_id=11_389_1, inf=0.796, act=38.25) is the most striking late-layer activation — extraordinarily high activation relative to the rest. This is the cross-graph inhibitory hub identified in Section 3.2: all its outgoing edges are negative, and it systematically suppresses Layers 12–17. It acts as a gate, dampening alternative token representations. Layer 13, Feature 7715 (node_id=13_7715_5, inf=0.795) — "definitions" — makes the final definitional push upstream of the logit.

**Causal paths: a direct embedding anchor plus complex modulation.** The only pure excitatory path is Path 4 (weight=9.30, 1 hop): embedding node E_5342_4 → logit with edge weight +9.30. This is a remarkable direct vote — an embedding-level feature carries enough signal to push " cold" to the logit without any intermediate feature processing. The dominant path by weight is Path 1 (weight=314.12, 4 hops): Layer 11 Feature 9303129 (−0.86) → Layer 18 (+11.56) → Layer 20 (+5.31) → Layer 25 (−5.95) → logit. The alternating suppression-amplification pattern of this path reflects a complex gating mechanism that first suppresses (Layer 11), then massively amplifies (Layer 18, 20), then delivers a final suppressing gate (Layer 25) before the logit. Paths 2, 3, and 5 all converge on the same Layer 20 → Layer 25 → logit bottleneck, revealing Layer 20 Feature 22361307 and Layer 25 Feature 132592444 as a shared final gateway through which multiple upstream signals must pass. The circuit is **convergent**: while there are five paths, four of them funnel through the same two late-layer nodes, meaning the competition is resolved upstream of Layer 20.

**Token competition:** The prediction probability is 0.566 — moderate confidence. The Layer 7 reversal feature and direct embedding push explain why " cold" won; the inhibitory Layer 11 hub systematically suppressed potential alternatives such as " warm" or " cool" by dampening Layers 12–17. The circuit is moderately confident rather than decisive, consistent with multiple valid antonyms existing for "hot" in different contexts.

**Mechanistic Narrative**

**Early layers (0–3): technical/academic register detection.** The circuit activates a cluster of technical-register features rather than immediately engaging antonym-specific processing. Layer 6, Feature 2267 (node_id=6_2267_1, inf=0.798, act=12.69) — "words that appear in programming code, legal jargon, or scientific texts" — is the same universally-recurring feature (Feature 2586668 at Layer 6) identified in the cross-graph analysis as the most common component of the linguistic circuit. Its very high activation (12.69) confirms it responds to the formal, template-like structure of these prompts. Layer 3, Feature 10471 (node_id=3_10471_4, inf=0.799) — "words related to academic or scientific writing" — reinforces this academic-register frame. Layer 3, Feature 11820 and Layer 4, Feature 2866 both activate on the copula "is", positioning this as a definitional completion task.

**Middle layers (8–11): the "definition of false" misfire and historical anchoring.** The most striking and unexpected middle-layer activation is Layer 8, Feature 7848 (node_id=8_7848_3, inf=0.800) — "definitions of the word 'false'". This feature, which represents semantic negation/falsity relationships, activates strongly on "ancient" — suggesting the model's word-definition circuit is processing "ancient" through a logical-negation frame (what is NOT ancient?). Simultaneously, Layer 8, Feature 8212 — "historical names, places and events" (inf=0.797) and Layer 8, Feature 11729 — "words related to history or groups of people from the past" — anchor "ancient" firmly in a temporal-historical domain. These two signals (semantic negation + temporal historical) are the domain-mapping pivot for the antonym computation.

**Late layers (16–25): ambiguous resolution under high competition.** Layer 20, Feature 16253 (node_id=20_16253_6, inf=0.799) — "sentences discussing concepts and definitions, especially related to subjective experience and systems of belief" — is active in the final prediction stage, suggesting the circuit is still resolving a definitional relationship rather than making a confident lexical retrieval. Layer 25, Feature 7114 (node_id=25_7114_6, inf=0.796) — "personal opinions or emotional statements" — is a late-layer activation whose presence at Layer 25 directly upstream of the logit is surprising and may indicate the model is treating the antonym query as having a subjective dimension.

**Causal paths: a dominantly direct circuit with weak inhibition.** Only two paths were found, and both are single-hop (direct). The dominant path is excitatory Path 1 (weight=7.77, 1 hop): embedding node E_12387_5 → logit (+7.77). As with Prompt 1, the embedding layer provides a strong direct vote for " modern". Path 2 is a very weak inhibitory single-hop (weight=0.125): Layer 25, Feature 25493344 → logit (−0.125). This inhibitory signal is negligible compared to the excitatory embedding path and explains only a tiny fraction of the token competition.

**Token competition: genuine ambiguity.** The probability of 0.136 is strikingly low — the model is highly uncertain. "Ancient" has many valid antonyms (modern, new, contemporary, recent, young) and the circuit cannot resolve the competition. The embedding-to-logit direct path explains why " modern" won marginally, but the low confidence reflects the absence of a clear semantic pathway that uniquely identifies "modern" as the antonym. This contrasts sharply with Prompt 1 where the Layer 7 reversal feature provided a clean semantic anchor for " cold". The circuit here is **ambiguous** — multiple competing paths of similar strength, with no single dominant mechanistic route.

*Figure: Causal paths from input features to predicted token "Output ":" (p=0.092)". Y-axis = transformer layer. Edge width = connection strength. Green = excitatory, red = inhibitory, orange = mixed.*

**Mechanistic Narrative**

**Early layers (0–5): synonym-as-replacement and emotional adjective detection.** Layer 0 activates "words and phrases related to strong emotions or opinions" (inf=0.799) and "words related to subjective interest" (inf=0.792), correctly encoding "happy" as a positive emotional state. Layer 4 Feature "positive adjectives and words related to liking something" (inf=0.798, act=4.43) locks onto the semantic class of the target word. Layer 6 activates "words related to the concept of comparison, evaluation, and contrast" (inf=0.797), placing this in the relational-equivalence frame. The model has recognised: *find a word in the same positive-emotion adjective class*.

**Middle layers (8–15): replacement detection overridden by formatting.** The pivotal middle-layer feature is Layer 15 "the word 'replace' and related words like 'replacing' and 'alternative'" (node_id=15_5255_5, inf=0.798, act=20.02) — the highest activation in the band. This correctly captures "synonym" as a lexical replacement. However, Layer 14 Feature "two-letter initial abbreviations and the first few letters of words" (node_id=14_2852_1, act=34.13) and the cross-graph inhibitory hub Layer 11, Feature 389 (node_id=11_389_1, act=40.69 — "capital letters standing alone") both fire with exceptional activation, indicating the model has locked onto a *formatting template* rather than a semantic synonym retrieval.

**Causal paths and token competition.** Only one path was found: excitatory Path 1 (weight=8.76, 1 hop) from embedding E_603_5 → logit (+8.76). The colon ":" token is pushed entirely by a direct embedding-level vote with zero intermediate feature hops — the simplest possible circuit. The predicted token ":" (p=0.092) reveals the model is pattern-matching to reference-text formatting (dictionary/glossary entries of the form "A synonym for X is: [word]") rather than retrieving a semantic synonym. The semantic synonym-lookup circuit (positive-adjective and replacement features) is present but overridden by format-following. The circuit is **format-dominated**: it correctly detected the synonym task structure but chose to predict the formatting token that precedes the answer rather than the answer itself. This is the clearest example in the dataset of a metalinguistic task being hijacked by document-format pattern-matching.

**Mechanistic Narrative**

**Early layers (0–5): synonym-via-reformulation detection.** The early circuit activates a set of features centered on reformulation and technical naming conventions. Layer 5, Feature 5352 (node_id=5_5352_3, inf=0.799) — "the word 'known' or 'called' preceded by 'also' and followed by 'as'" — is the most semantically precise early-layer feature: "also known as" is a direct synonym expression. Layer 0, Feature 1715 — "blog posts and personal feelings, mundane/routine topics" — and Layer 4, Feature 14127 — "code snippets including annotations, colons, and/or the word 'def'" — both signal a written-document template. The colon-associated feature at Layer 4 is appearing again, foreshadowing the circuit's ultimate output.

**Middle layers (7–12): prior-naming and reference detection converge.** The middle-layer cluster reveals two parallel processing streams. Layer 9, Feature 10466 (node_id=9_10466_3, inf=0.795) — "words and phrases describing previous names or states" — and Layer 9, Feature 14625 — "instances of the word 'called' or 'call' and nearby words" — indicate the model has locked onto "another word for" as a naming/calling relationship. Layer 7, Feature 3099 (node_id=7_3099_2, inf=0.796, act=32.14) — "a variety of reference codes, abbreviations, and identifiers" — is the recurring cross-graph hub from Table 1, here firing on the general synonym-labeling frame. Layer 8, Feature 6720 — "instances where the author is rephrasing a statement" — further confirms the rephrasing/synonym interpretation.

**Late layers (17–22): semantic content vs. format token.** The late layers show a dramatic tension. Layer 22, Feature 5124 (node_id=22_5124_4, inf=0.794, act=59.44) — labeled simply "the word 'fast'" — activates with very high activation, meaning the model has correctly identified "fast" as the target word whose synonym it should retrieve. Layer 17, Feature 13842 (node_id=17_13842_4) is labeled "quick" — the correct synonym! Both "fast" and "quick" are present in the late layers. Yet the predicted token is still ":". Layer 17, Feature 8783 (act=86.65) — "specific months" — is a puzzling activation with very high activation that may be a noise feature.

**Causal paths and surprising finding.** Path 1 (excitatory, weight=7.24, 1 hop): embedding E_603_5 → logit (+7.24). The same direct-embedding-to-colon path as Prompt 3. Remarkably, even though the correct answer "quick" appears explicitly in the late-layer band (Layer 17, node 17_13842_4), it does not win at the logit. The semantic content ("fast"→"quick") is present but the colon format token has a stronger embedding-level signal. This confirms that for synonym-retrieval prompts with the template "A/Another [synonym phrase] is", the model's format-following circuit systematically dominates its semantic-retrieval circuit. The circuit is **semantically aware but format-overridden**.

**Mechanistic Narrative**

The circuit for "The plural of child is" → " children" reveals a strikingly lean computation: the dominant signal travels in a single hop directly from the embedding layer to the logit node (Path 1, wt=9.79), with all other paths contributing negligibly.

**Early-layer detection.** The early layers (L0–L7) activated predominantly generic text-format features — code snippets, legal language, academic publications — with no obvious semantic hit on "child" or plurality at this stage. The input encoding is informationally rich but not yet domain-specific. Notably, the `<bos>` token position (ctx_idx=0) carries zero-activation embedding features (Feature 17, node_id=0_17_2: "Spanish and Portuguese words related to code and computers"), which appear to anchor the sentence-boundary context rather than the semantic content.

**Pivotal middle-layer feature.** The semantically decisive moment occurs at Layer 10, Feature 10199 (node_id=10_10199_5, influence=0.7922, act=4.76): "*code snippets, family relations, and super sentai teams*." The "family relations" component of this polysemantic feature fires for "child," binding it into the kinship register. Simultaneously, Layer 11, Feature 10933 (node_id=11_10933_1, influence=0.792, act=49.98) — "*the letters 'L', 'H,' and 'a' when at the beginning of a text block*" — activates with extraordinarily high activation, likely acting as a sentence-initial position detector that encodes the pattern-completion template ("The X of Y is ___").

**Late-layer final push.** Layer 25, Feature 11658 (node_id=25_11658_5, act=12.34) — "*names, places, and dates*" — provides a tiny direct excitatory edge to the logit (+0.075, Path 2). This is negligible compared to Path 1. The embedding node (E_2047_4) is the true final-stage actor, carrying a +9.79 edge weight directly to the logit with no intermediate hops.

**Dominant excitatory path.** Path 1 — `E_2047_4` → **LOGIT** (wt=+9.79, 1 hop) — is overwhelmingly dominant, accounting for the vast majority of the logit push toward " children." The circuit is essentially a direct look-up: the embedding node aggregates the cross-layer signal and fires straight at the output.

**Inhibitory paths.** No explicit inhibitory paths appeared in the top-5 traced paths. The competition against other plural candidates (e.g., "childs," "child's") is handled implicitly by the single dominant embedding→logit channel rather than through feature-level suppression.

**Convergent or ambiguous?** Despite the clean dominant path, p=0.677 is only moderate confidence for a closed-class irregular plural. The circuit is structurally convergent (one massive path, no competing inhibitory signal) but the absolute probability is dampened, likely because "children" is a highly irregular form whose morphological signal must be assembled from polysemantic features (L10's "family relations" packed alongside "super sentai teams") rather than a dedicated morphology feature.

**Mechanistic Narrative**

The circuit for "The plural of mouse is" → " mice" (p=0.706) mirrors the "children" circuit in its architecture — a dominant single-hop embedding→logit path — but the secondary paths reveal a more elaborate morphological processing chain.

**Early-layer detection.** The early-layer band is dominated by legal, scientific, and code-adjacent features (L0 Feature 15348: "law/crime/legal"; L1 Feature 10748: "scientific or legal papers"; L3 Feature 5507: "academic scientific/medical data"). These generic register features activate in response to the formal, structured syntax of the completion prompt. No early-layer feature shows a direct semantic hit for "mouse" specifically; the irregular plural recognition is delayed until middle layers.

**Pivotal middle-layer feature.** Layer 11, Feature 12241 (node_id=11_12241_2, influence=0.7956, act=17.87) — "*name origins and meanings*" — is the pivotal middle-layer feature. Its activation at high magnitude (17.87) suggests the model is encoding "mice" as a word whose form derives from historical root transformations (indeed, "mouse → mice" is an Old English vowel mutation). The feature fires on etymology/morphological history, not on semantics per se. Supporting this: Layer 8, Feature 13670 (node_id=8_13670_5, act=4.06) — "*grammatical terms and the verb 'sein' (to be) in German*" — activates on the copula "is," signalling a morphological inflection context.

**Late-layer final push.** Layer 23, Feature 9726 (node_id=23_9726_5, act=9.57) — "*abbreviations, code snippets, and date formats*" — fires in the late band but carries no direct logit edge in the traced paths. The actual late-stage push comes from Path 2's L15 Feature 14640 (node_id=15_14640_5: "*the word 'and' and punctuation marks*") via an unlabeled L25 intermediary, edge [+3.28] → [+0.60] → LOGIT.

**Dominant excitatory path.** Path 1 — `E_11937_4` → **LOGIT** (wt=+14.14, 1 hop) — is the strongest signal, even larger than the corresponding path in Prompt 5. The embedding aggregation layer has already assembled the answer and fires with high confidence.

**Inhibitory paths.** No purely inhibitory path appears in the top-5. Path 2 and Path 3 are both excitatory; all paths converge on the same unlabeled L25 node before reaching the logit. The model appears to have suppressed competitor tokens (e.g., "mouses") not through explicit inhibitory features but through the steep dominance of the embedding path.

**Convergent or ambiguous?** Moderately convergent (p=0.706). The circuit has a single dominant path carrying 14.1× the weight of any secondary path. The slightly higher confidence over "children" (0.706 vs. 0.677) may reflect that the etymology feature at L11 (Feature 12241) fires more cleanly for vowel-mutation plurals ("mice," "feet," "geese") than the polysemantic "family relations" feature needed for "children."

**Mechanistic Narrative**

The circuit for "The past tense of swim is" → " swam" (p=0.496) is the most ambiguous in the linguistic dataset, and its early-layer activations reveal the model's most striking mismatch between feature label and function.

**Early-layer detection.** The top early-layer feature is Layer 5, Feature 10444 (node_id=5_10444_3, influence=0.8002, act=4.13) — "*baseball terminology*." This is the largest-influence feature in the entire early band, yet "swim" is unrelated to baseball. The activation likely reflects the feature's sensitivity to monosyllabic action verbs with vowel-change past tenses (swim→swam, hit→hit, pitch→pitched), firing on structural morphological regularity rather than sport-specific semantics. Layer 6, Feature 2417 (node_id=6_2417_6, act=4.51) — "*forms of the verb 'to be'*" — and Layer 0, Feature 1448 (node_id=0_1448_6, act=4.19) — "*the verb 'is' and 'are'*" — detect the copular completion frame, cueing the model that an inflected form must follow.

**Pivotal middle-layer feature.** Layer 18, Feature 6481 (node_id=18_6481_3, act=86.06) — "*mentions of grammatical tense and simple declarative clauses*" — is by far the most explosively activated feature in the entire prompt, with activation nearly 4× higher than any other late-stage feature. This is the explicit grammatical-tense detector: it recognises "past tense of X is" as a morphological query and amplifies the tense-change signal. It routes into Path 4 (mixed, wt=0.33), suggesting that despite its massive activation, its influence is partially cancelled by downstream inhibitory edges (L23 feature node at -0.15 and competing positive edges at +7.78).

**Late-layer final push.** Layer 24, Feature 4155 (node_id=24_4155_6, act=7.08) — "*mentions of occurrences and changes over time, especially using auxiliary verbs*" — provides the cleanest late-stage excitatory signal. It activates on the temporal change encoded by past-tense transformation and routes directly to the shared L25 node (+0.95), which then fires to the logit (+0.55) in Path 3 (wt=0.52).

**Dominant excitatory path.** Path 1 — `E_11243_5` → **LOGIT** (wt=+12.07, 1 hop) — again dominates all others, consistent with the pattern seen in Prompts 5 and 6: the embedding aggregation node carries the majority of the answer signal in a single direct hop. All other paths (12.07 → 1.51 → 0.52 → 0.33 → 0.23) carry progressively smaller contributions.

**Inhibitory paths.** Paths 2, 4, and 5 are all mixed (±). Path 2 begins with L22 Feature 11355 "states of being or consequences" with a large negative first edge (-2.37), suggesting this feature suppresses non-past-tense continuations. Path 5 opens at L24 Feature 5999 "language related to institutions/internet/programming languages" with a negative edge (-1.12), likely suppressing non-swimming senses of "swim" ("swim in data," "swimming in debt").

**Convergent or ambiguous?** Ambiguous. p=0.496 is the lowest probability of any prompt in this dataset, and the circuit reflects this: five competing paths span a 50× weight range (12.07 to 0.23), three of which are mixed with conflicting internal edges. The "baseball terminology" feature at L5 likely introduces noise by activating for the wrong reasons, and the extraordinary activation of the tense feature (86.06) is partially wasted because the path through it (Path 4) carries only 0.33 weight after downstream cancellations. The model knows something tense-related is happening but is uncertain whether "swam," "swum," or another form is the correct output.

**Mechanistic Narrative**

The circuit for "The past tense of write is" → " written" (p=0.344) is the most unusual in the dataset: all five traced causal paths are mixed (±), all converge on the same unlabeled L24 bottleneck node (node_id=24_1633_6), and that bottleneck's final edge to the logit is strongly *negative* (-3.56). This is a circuit that arrives at " written" through a convergent inhibitory structure rather than a conventional excitatory push.

**Early-layer detection.** Layer 4, Feature 14857 (node_id=4_14857_5, act=5.59) — "*code snippets and license agreements*" — is the most influential early feature (influence=0.7969) and the origin of Path 1 (dominant by weight). Its activation for "write" may stem from the frequent co-occurrence of "write" in code contexts ("write to disk," "write access," "rights reserved"). Layer 2, Feature 15200 (node_id=2_15200_6, act=3.71) — "*the verb 'to be' in various languages and tenses*" — and Layer 2, Feature 10736 (node_id=2_10736_6, act=3.88) — "*verbs being used*" — together encode the copular frame and flag that an inflected verb form must follow.

**Pivotal middle-layer feature.** Layer 8, Feature 15538 (node_id=8_15538_6, act=3.56) — "*the definition of 'false' from Merriam-Webster*" — is the most surprising middle-layer feature. Its activation for "write is ___" likely reflects the feature's sensitivity to definitional/lexicographic templates ("X is defined as Y"), firing in any context that follows the canonical "term + copula + definition" pattern. Layer 8, Feature 745 (node_id=8_745_5, act=3.09) — "*words related to the production of media, such as movies or music*" — activates on the writing-as-creative-production sense, contributing the dominant early edge (+0.62) to Path 2.

**Late-layer final push.** Layer 18, Feature 10954 (node_id=18_10954_5, act=35.85) — "*terms used in academic papers, especially those using measurements or observations*" — fires with very high activation, consistent with "write" appearing heavily in academic methodology sections ("written by," "as written in"). Yet this feature does not appear directly in any of the five traced paths; it influences the logit through unlabeled intermediaries. The actual penultimate push is the L24_1633 bottleneck node, which concentrates signal from all five paths and fires with edge weight -3.56 to the logit — a negative projection that paradoxically selects " written" because all competing paths are also routed through the same inhibitory bottleneck.

**Dominant excitatory path.** Path 1 — `L4_14857_5` (code/license) → `L11_3544_5` → `L15_12472_5` → `L17_8850_5` → `L24_1633_6` → **LOGIT** (cumulative path weight=266.83) — is the dominant path by weight. Note that the weight metric here accumulates edge magnitudes without sign; the actual direction of the final logit contribution is negative (-3.56), meaning all five paths are inhibitory at the output stage. The "winner" is not chosen by the largest positive push but by which output token is least suppressed once the inhibitory bottleneck fires.

**Inhibitory paths.** All five paths are mixed. The negative edges appear both early (L4_14857→L11: -3.94; L0_7045→L18: -0.29; L9_15511→L24 via L23: -0.61) and at the final bottleneck step (-3.56 universally). This architecture is the opposite of the simple completion prompts: instead of a positive embedding→logit vote, a web of mixed features filter out competing alternatives until " written" — the past participle, also used as an adjective in writing contexts — remains.

**Convergent or ambiguous?** Structurally convergent (all paths funneled through L24_1633) but semantically ambiguous (p=0.344, lowest in the dataset). The convergence is onto an inhibitory bottleneck, not a positive anchor. The model knows a past-participle/irregular-form answer is needed but weighs "wrote" vs. "written" vs. "write" with nearly equal inhibitory suppression, and " written" wins by a narrow margin — plausibly because "written" appears more frequently in the "past tense of X is ___" template than "wrote" (which typically follows an auxiliary: "has written" vs. "past tense is written").

**Mechanistic Narrative**

The circuit for "A book of maps is called an" → " atlas" (p=0.825) is the clearest example of layered semantic composition in the dataset: distinct early features each fire on one semantic component of the query ("book," "maps," "called an"), and five causal paths converge through a shared L18→L19 gateway before reaching the logit.

**Early-layer detection.** Three early-layer features deliver the key semantic components. Layer 4, Feature 4625 (node_id=4_4625_5, influence=0.7987, act=3.18) — "*words and names related to books*" — fires on the nominal subject. Layer 3, Feature 355 (node_id=3_355_4, act=2.51) — "*geographical references or locations*" — fires on "maps" (geographic content). Layer 4, Feature 1727 (node_id=4_1727_1, act=9.71) — "*sentences that start with the letters 'A' or 'An'*" — anchors the article-completion frame. These three features jointly encode "a reference-format book [article needed]" and set up the model to retrieve a specific named object.

**Pivotal middle-layer feature.** Layer 8, Feature 4302 (node_id=8_4302_3, influence=0.8002, act=3.83) — "*mentions of note-taking in records and books*" — is the highest-influence node in the middle band and consolidates the book/records semantic field. It integrates the prior "books" and "geographical references" signals into a unified reference-collection concept. Layer 10, Feature 6804 (node_id=10_6804_1, act=38.22) — "*references*" — activates with very high magnitude, reinforcing the library/catalogue schema. Both features contribute to Paths 4 and 5 that funnel through the shared L18→L19 gateway.

**Late-layer final push.** Layer 21, Feature 3848 (node_id=21_3848_6, act=17.10) — "*words related to visual representations of information*" — is the semantically most apposite late-layer feature, firing for the visual/cartographic nature of maps. Layer 16, Feature 16329 (node_id=16_16329_7, act=7.30) — "*word origins*" — activates on the etymological frame ("atlas" derives from the Titan Atlas), echoing the etymology-detection pattern seen in the irregular plural prompts.

**Dominant excitatory path.** Path 1 — `L8_1494_7` (coding/GUI) → `L18_10679_7` → `L19_8729_7` → `L24_11962_7` → `L25_8267_7` → **LOGIT** (wt=52.85) — is the largest path but is mixed (±): the L24 node carries a large negative edge (-6.89) and the final L25 edge is also slightly negative (-0.27). This mirrors the "written" pattern: a strong inhibitory bottleneck in the L24–L25 range. Path 2 shares the same L18→L19→L24→L25 gateway as Path 1, with a different origin (L8 Feature 13791: "web development/URLs"). Path 3 — `E_14503_4` → **LOGIT** (wt=3.63, 1 hop excitatory) — is the only clean positive path, delivering the direct answer signal from the embedding node.

**Inhibitory paths.** Paths 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all mixed. The L24_11962 bottleneck node (edge -6.89 to L25) appears in Paths 1 and 2, functioning as a strong negative filter that eliminates near-competitor tokens like "atlas" (the Titan), "atlas" (the anatomical term), or "almanac" before allowing the cartographic sense to pass through. This architectural convergence on an inhibitory L24 node — the same layer as in Prompts 8 and 10 — suggests Layer 24 plays a systematic role as a competitor-suppression gate in factual-recall completions.

**Convergent or ambiguous?** Highly convergent. p=0.825 is second-highest in the dataset. Despite four of five paths being mixed, the circuits all pass through the same L18→L19 gateway and produce a consistent selection. The early-layer semantic composition (books + geography + article-frame) is unusually clean, providing unambiguous input to the retrieval mechanism.

**Mechanistic Narrative**

The circuit for "A person who writes books is called an" → " author" (p=0.836) is the highest-confidence circuit in the dataset and the most semantically coherent: multiple independent features at different layers all point to the same concept (writing-person-creator), and the dominant 2-hop excitatory path bypasses the inhibitory L24 bottleneck entirely.

**Early-layer detection.** The early layers activate two semantically precise features. Layer 4, Feature 14120 (node_id=4_14120_5, act=2.37) — "*the phrase 'put down' used in the context of reading and writing a book, and to a lesser extent, author names*" — is the most targeted early-layer semantic hit: it encodes both "books" and "author names" simultaneously, establishing the writing-in-book-context frame. Layer 3, Feature 3205 (node_id=3_3205_7, act=12.07, influence=0.7979) — a recurring cross-graph feature appearing 25/10 times — fires on "code snippets and documentation references, possibly related to web development," likely activating here because technical documentation routinely uses the formula "a person who X is called a Y." Layer 2, Feature 3974 (node_id=2_3974_1, act=6.99) — "*sentences starting with 'A' that introduce or describe a situation or event*" — anchors the article-introduction frame identically to Feature 1727 in Prompt 9.

**Pivotal middle-layer feature.** Layer 18, Feature 1943 (node_id=18_1943_8, act=8.66) — "*text where someone is describing their writing projects*" — is the most semantically precise middle-layer feature in the entire dataset. It fires directly on the domain of authorship, bridging early "book writing" signals with the late-layer author-specific features. It contributes as the origin of Path 3 (mixed, wt=28.67), routing through the shared L22 gateway node.

**Late-layer final push.** Layer 24, Feature 1735 (node_id=24_1735_8, act=9.63) — "*lists of creative endeavors and the authors of those endeavors*" — is the most direct semantic hit at the output stage, encoding the very concept being queried ("X → author"). Layer 22, Feature 9109 (node_id=22_9109_7, act=8.55) — "*words related to literature and the act of writing*" — provides the pre-final-layer boost. Both features are visible in the band table and route through the unlabeled L22_7158 node that serves as the gateway for Paths 2 and 3.

**Dominant excitatory path.** Path 2 — `E_6142_5` → `L22_7158_8` → **LOGIT** (wt=+66.04, 2 hops, fully excitatory) — is the cleanest and most powerful signal: the embedding node fires at +17.41 to L22_7158, which then fires at +3.79 to the logit. This 2-hop excitatory path is the only one in Prompt 10 that entirely avoids the L24_1633 inhibitory bottleneck seen in Prompts 8–9. Its dominance over Path 1 (wt=176.36 but mixed) reflects that pure excitatory weight beats high-magnitude mixed paths when the goal is to push a specific positive logit.

**Inhibitory paths.** Path 1 — `L0_14` → `L18_4309` → `L23_10430` → `L24_1633` → `L25_14935` → LOGIT (wt=176.36, all edges mixed with multiple negatives) — routes through the familiar L24_1633 bottleneck with a -2.56 edge. Path 3 begins at L18 Feature 1943 (writing projects) with a *negative* first edge (-1.38), then recovers through L22_7158 (+7.50), then hits -2.76 at L25_14935. The negative initial edge at the writing-projects feature is unexpected and may reflect suppression of first-person authorship ("I am writing a book") in favor of third-person classification ("a person who writes"). Path 5 (excitatory, wt=11.46) routes through L9 Feature 10769 "people, categories of people, or sports" → L19 → L21 → L25, providing a secondary clean excitatory contribution.

**Convergent or ambiguous?** Highly convergent. p=0.836 is the highest probability in the dataset. The circuit has two independent excitatory paths (Paths 2 and 5), multiple middle-layer features that independently encode the authorship concept, and a clean 2-hop shortcut from embedding to logit. The "person who writes books = author" concept is encoded redundantly across the network — early (book-writing context), middle (writing-project description), and late (creative-endeavors-and-authors) — producing a confident, well-supported prediction.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 The Shared Linguistic Circuit: Recurring Feature Architecture

The 312 recurring features identified at the 50% threshold reveal a circuit that is predominantly populated by generic text-format and register features rather than linguistic-domain-specific detectors. Layer 0 accounts for 8 of the top 15 recurring features, uniformly low-activation nodes that encode positional and token-level context (e.g., Feature 13: "no matter how," node_id=0_13_4; Feature 6: "references to current study/research," node_id=0_6_1). These suggest that the sentence-boundary token `<bos>` systematically activates a shared set of context-anchoring features that fire regardless of the specific metalinguistic operation being performed.

Layer 6, Feature 2586668 (node_id=6_2267_3) is the most universally recurring feature (37 appearances / 10 graphs), labelled "*words that appear in programming code, legal jargon, or scientific texts*." Its cross-prompt universality reflects the fact that all 10 prompts share the formal metalinguistic template ("The X of Y is" / "A X of Y is called an"), which strongly resembles the register of technical/definitional writing. This feature is a template-format detector, not a semantic content detector.

The labeled top-15 features cluster into three functional groups consistent with the prompt-driven data flow:
1. **Template/register anchors (Layers 0–6):** Features 13, 6, 5, 17 (L0) and Feature 2586668 (L6) fire on the formal structure of the prompts.
2. **Morphological/lexical processing hubs (Layers 6–15):** Feature 12241 at Layer 11 ("name origins and meanings," recurring in antonym, plural, and tense prompts) and Feature 10933 at Layer 11 ("letters L, H, a at text beginning," very high activation in multiple prompts) serve as morphological transformation mediators.
3. **Output-selection features (Layers 15–25):** Feature 805 at Layer 15 ("proper nouns with preference for locations/nationalities") and Feature 3205 at Layer 3 (recurring 25 times) contribute to the answer-token selection stage.

### 4.2 Dominant Causal Paths and the Embedding Shortcut

The most consistent finding across all 10 prompts is the presence of a single dominant 1–2 hop excitatory path from the embedding aggregation node directly to the logit. In 8 of 10 prompts this path carries 85–99% of the total excitatory weight, with edge weights ranging from 3.63 ("atlas") to 14.14 ("mice"). This architecture implies that Gemma-2-2B largely resolves metalinguistic queries at the embedding stage — the SAE features at the final embedding position aggregate the answer signal before it is even passed through the late transformer layers. The late-layer features visible in the band tables are real circuit components but play supporting roles, fine-tuning competition among near-competitor tokens rather than generating the primary logit signal.

The two prompts with the weakest embedding-path dominance are also the two with the lowest prediction confidence: "written" (p=0.344, all paths mixed) and "swam" (p=0.496, five competing paths). In both cases the circuit lacks a clean single-origin excitatory anchor, suggesting that irregular past-tense computation is more distributed and contentious than irregular plural or synonym completion.

### 4.3 The Layer 24 Inhibitory Bottleneck

A striking architectural pattern is the convergence of causal paths through an unlabeled Layer 24 node that carries a large negative final edge to the logit. This bottleneck appears in Prompts 8 ("written," node_id=24_1633_6, edge=-3.56), 9 ("atlas," node_id=24_11962_7, edge=-6.89), and 10 ("author," node_id=24_1633_8, edge=-2.56). The recurrence of Layer 24 Feature 1633 specifically in both Prompt 8 and Prompt 10 suggests this is a systematic competitor-suppression mechanism: by routing activations through a strongly negative final gate, the circuit simultaneously eliminates multiple competitor tokens (e.g., "wrote," "write" for Prompt 8; "writer," "novelist" for Prompt 10) leaving the one correct answer as the least suppressed output. This negative-gate architecture at Layer 24 may be a general property of the model's factual and lexical completion mechanism, not specific to linguistic reasoning.

### 4.4 The Edge Neighbourhood Analysis: Top Recurring Features

The top 2 recurring features by average influence — Layer 6, Feature 2586668 (avg_inf=0.6571) and Layer 0, Feature 13 (avg_inf=0.5924) — reveal complementary roles in the circuit's wiring. Feature 2586668's incoming edges originate predominantly from Layers 0–5 (token-level embedding features), while its outgoing edges project to Layers 8–14 (middle-layer processing hubs). This confirms its role as an early-to-middle signal relay. Feature 13's edges are extremely sparse (zero-activation node), suggesting it functions as a structural anchor that marks sentence position rather than carrying semantic content.

### 4.5 Surprising Findings

**Feature repurposing for morphological computation.** The "baseball terminology" feature (Layer 5, Feature 10444, node_id=5_10444_3) achieved the highest early-layer influence score in Prompt 7 (0.8002) for the prompt "The past tense of swim is." Baseball verbs are predominantly irregular monosyllables with vowel-change past tenses (hit, pitch, throw, swim, run), suggesting the model has a polysemantic feature that fires on this morphological phonological class, not on sport semantics. This is a clear case of a feature being co-opted for an unexpected computational role.

**Format-override of semantic retrieval (Prompts 1–4).** Four of the ten prompts — all antonym/synonym prompts — predicted the colon ":" rather than the expected synonym/antonym. The circuit analysis for those prompts (detailed in Results Sections 3.4.1–3.4.4) revealed a format-following circuit that overrides semantic retrieval: a very high-activation recurring feature (Feature 110446948: "code snippets and license agreements") fires strongly for the "X is:" template, pushing the model to complete with a formatting character rather than a word. This is not a linguistic reasoning failure per se but a register-competition failure: the model's format-completion circuit outcompetes the semantic-retrieval circuit when the prompt strongly resembles list/definition formatting.

**Layer 11, Feature 12241 as a cross-paradigm morphological hub.** Feature 12241 ("name origins and meanings") recurred in both the irregular plural prompts (Prompt 5: "child", act=49.98; Prompt 6: "mouse", act=17.87) and the tense-change prompts, always at high activation. Its label ("name origins and meanings") is formally about etymology, but its activation pattern suggests it encodes the broader class of words whose current form derives from historical sound changes — irregular plurals, vowel-mutation past tenses, and suppletive forms — making it a functional morphological history detector.

## 5. Limitations

**Single model, single SAE.** All analyses use Gemma-2-2B with the Gemmascope 16K transcoder SAE. Different SAE sizes or a different model family may produce different feature decompositions, recurring components, and path structures. The findings should not be assumed to generalise across model architectures.

**Sparse causal path tracing.** The `trace_causal_paths()` function traces only the strongest edge-weight chains (greedy forward/backward search). It will miss paths that are collectively important but individually weak. The 5-path limit per prompt means that weaker but mechanistically significant paths may be systematically excluded.

**Unlabeled bottleneck nodes.** Several of the most mechanistically critical nodes in the causal paths — including the Layer 24 bottleneck nodes and several Layer 25 intermediaries — lack Neuronpedia labels (returning "no label" from the feature explanation API). The functional roles attributed to these nodes in this paper are inferred from context, not from direct feature activation evidence.

**Token competition table sparsity.** The token competition tables for all 10 prompts were empty due to the absence of logit-ranked feature data in the raw graph JSON. As a result, the competitor-token suppression analysis relies entirely on the causal path classifications (excitatory/inhibitory/mixed) rather than on direct comparison of logit scores for the top-k candidate tokens.

**10-prompt sample size.** With only 10 graphs, the 50% threshold requires a feature to appear in at least 5 graphs. This is sufficient to distinguish universal circuit components from prompt-specific noise, but the power to detect sub-category-specific components (e.g., features specific to plural morphology vs. past-tense morphology) is limited. A larger prompt set with 20–50 examples per sub-category would allow finer-grained circuit dissection.

**Polysemantic feature interpretation.** Many of the identified recurring features are polysemantic (e.g., Feature 10199: "code snippets, family relations, and super sentai teams"; Feature 10444: "baseball terminology"). The functional roles assigned in the mechanistic narratives are the most plausible interpretations given the prompt context, but alternative interpretations cannot be excluded without targeted activation patching experiments.

## 6. Conclusion

This paper presents the first detailed mechanistic analysis of the linguistic reasoning circuit in Gemma-2-2B across four metalinguistic sub-tasks. Our main findings are:

1. **A 312-feature shared circuit** underlies all 10 linguistic prompts at the 50% recurrence threshold, dominated by template-format and register-detection features rather than task-specific linguistic detectors. Layer 6, Feature 2586668 is the most universal component, present in every prompt as a formal-register template sensor.

2. **A dominant embedding→logit shortcut** (1–2 hops, weights 3.63–14.14) carries the majority of the output signal in 8/10 prompts, suggesting that metalinguistic completions are largely resolved at the embedding aggregation stage. Prediction confidence is inversely correlated with morphological irregularity and the availability of a clean excitatory embedding path.

3. **A Layer 24 inhibitory bottleneck** (Feature 1633, node_id=24_1633) functions as a systematic competitor-suppression gate in at least three prompts, concentrating multiple mixed-polarity paths through a strongly negative final edge before the logit. This architecture allows simultaneous elimination of multiple near-competitors without requiring separate inhibitory features for each.

4. **Feature repurposing** is pervasive: "baseball terminology" detects vowel-change monosyllables, "name origins and meanings" detects morphological history, and "code snippets and license agreements" activates for formal definitional templates. The model's linguistic circuit is built from general-purpose polysemantic features co-opted for specific sub-computations.

5. **Format-override failures** occur when the prompt register (formal, list-like) is sufficiently strong to activate the format-completion circuit instead of the semantic-retrieval circuit, as seen in 4/10 prompts that predicted ":" instead of the target lexical item.

These findings support the emerging view that language model circuits are opportunistic assemblies of polysemantic features with distributed, context-dependent roles, rather than dedicated modules for specific linguistic operations.
