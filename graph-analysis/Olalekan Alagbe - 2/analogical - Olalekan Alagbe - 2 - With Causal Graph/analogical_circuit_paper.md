# Mechanistic Interpretability of Analogical Reasoning in Gemma-2-2B: A Circuit Analysis

## Abstract

We present a mechanistic interpretability analysis of analogical reasoning in Gemma-2-2B across 10 diverse A:B::C:? prompts. Attribution graphs were generated for each prompt via the Neuronpedia transcoder SAE (gemmascope-transcoder-16k), and 429 recurring circuit features were identified at a 50% appearance threshold. The 15 most universal features span layers 0–10, with the top features being: L6/F2586668 (structural/formal register, 48/10 graphs), L3/F5150441 (code-documentation patterns, 47/10), L8/F94882191 ("analogies or comparisons," 41/10), L4/F110446948 (license/code patterns, 37/10), and L7/F4828270 (reference codes and abbreviations, 31/10). Per-prompt causal path analysis reveals that model confidence correlates with path clarity: geographic capital-city analogies (Paris/Germany, p=0.97; Cairo/Kenya, p=0.96) show convergent 3–5-hop causal chains with strong domain-specific features, while functional/botanical analogies (Fish/air, p=0.12; Leaf/flower, p=0.14) produce diffuse, mixed-sign path structures with no clear dominant mechanism. Explicit analogy-detection features at Layers 7, 8, 9, and 15 are identified. Five of ten prompts contain purely excitatory causal paths; all ten show convergent late-layer aggregation through Layers 21–25 to the logit node at Layer 27. The results suggest that Gemma-2-2B implements analogical reasoning through a two-stage circuit: a universal structural-parsing stage (Layers 0–6) shared across all prompts, and a domain-specific resolution stage (Layers 7–27) that varies in strength with the clarity of the relational mapping.

## Introduction

This paper presents a mechanistic interpretability analysis of analogical reasoning in Gemma-2-2B, a 2-billion parameter transformer language model. Analogical reasoning — the ability to identify and complete structural relationships of the form A:B::C:? — is a fundamental component of abstract intelligence. We investigate how this capability is implemented at the level of individual model features using attribution graphs generated via the Neuronpedia platform.

We selected 10 analogical reasoning prompts spanning diverse relational categories: geographic (capital cities), biological (animal/habitat, life stages), physical (tools/measurements), functional (activities), botanical (plant structures), mechanical (vehicle components), and social (institutional roles). For each prompt, we generated an attribution graph over Gemma-2-2B's transcoder features, then identified recurring circuit components across graphs using a 50% appearance threshold.

Our analysis reveals the specific layers and features that constitute the analogical reasoning circuit in Gemma-2-2B, the causal paths through which information flows from input tokens to the final predicted token, and the mechanistic basis for token selection in this class of reasoning task.

## Methods

**Model.** Gemma-2-2B (Google DeepMind), a 26-layer transformer language model.

**SAE.** Gemmascope transcoder, 16k features per layer, applied at all transformer layers.

**Graph generation.** Attribution graphs were generated via the Neuronpedia API (`/api/graph/generate`) with parameters: `maxFeatureNodes=3000`, `desiredLogitProb=0.95`, `nodeThreshold=0.8`, `edgeThreshold=0.85`. Each graph captures the most influential transcoder features and their edge weights for a single prompt.

**Recurring feature identification.** `compare_graphs()` was run across all 10 graphs with `threshold=0.50` (a feature must appear in ≥5/10 graphs to qualify as a shared circuit component). This threshold distinguishes category-level circuit structure from prompt-specific noise.

**Node labeling.** Recurring features were labeled via the Neuronpedia `/api/feature/{model}/{sae}/{feature}` endpoint, which returns human-readable descriptions derived from automated interpretability methods.

**Causal path tracing.** `trace_causal_paths()` traces the dominant signal pathways from influential input features to the logit node by following edge weights through the graph. Paths are scored by the product of absolute edge weights across hops and classified as excitatory (+), inhibitory (−), or mixed (±).

**Per-prompt interpretation.** `interpret_prompt_graph()` labels the top 40 nodes per graph (grouped into early/middle/late layer bands), identifies token competition, traces causal paths, generates a causal path figure, and appends all data to this paper.

**Prompt dataset.** 10 analogical reasoning prompts:
1. Paris is to France as Berlin is to
2. Cairo is to Egypt as Nairobi is to
3. Fish is to water as bird is to
4. Puppy is to dog as kitten is to
5. Clock is to time as thermometer is to
6. Book is to reading as radio is to
7. Leaf is to tree as petal is to
8. Wheel is to car as wing is to
9. Judge is to court as priest is to
10. Soldier is to army as sailor is to

### Edge Neighbourhood Analysis (Step 5a)

**Top feature by avg_influence: node_id=7_3099_1 (L7, F4828270, "reference codes, abbreviations, and identifiers")**

Analysis performed on the graph for "Cairo is to Egypt as Nairobi is to".

- **In-degree:** 11, **Out-degree:** 7
- **Top incoming edges:** E_2_0 (embedding, w=−38.73), L4/F110446948 (w=−13.61), L3/F5150441 (w=−6.45), L6/F48733121 (w=−5.42), L5/F7993995 (w=−4.95), embedding/F1 (w=+4.81), L4/F47653198 (w=+3.36), L0/F26978184 (w=+3.05)
- **Top outgoing edges:** L10/F100614194 (w=+1.84), L9/F4701701 (w=+1.22), L10/F59891029 (w=+1.10), L9/F125286525 (w=−1.01), L18/F63861932 (w=−0.22), L27/F28273 (w=−0.02)

Key observations: This feature is strongly modulated by embedding-layer inputs (E_2_0 with weight −38.73), suggesting it fires in response to the specific token embeddings encoding the relation markers ("is to", "as"). Its strongest outgoing connections reach layers 10, 9, and ultimately layer 27, suggesting it participates in a long-range excitatory pathway toward the logit.

**Second feature by avg_influence: node_id=6_2267_4 (L6, F2586668, "programming code, legal jargon, scientific texts")**

Analysis performed on the graph for "Paris is to France as Berlin is to".

- **In-degree:** 7, **Out-degree:** 16
- **Top incoming edges:** embedding E_2_0 (w=−7.33), E_29437_1 (w=−6.37), E_6081_4 (w=+3.92), L5/F−1 (w=+2.66), E_603_2 (w=+2.60), L4/F110446948 (w=−1.39), L3/F−1 (w=−1.08)
- **Top outgoing edges:** L8/F45300912 (w=+0.74), L10/F133489619 (w=+0.60), L15/F55825445 (w=+0.56), L10/F19521865 (w=+0.52), L9/F63095751 (w=+0.46), L12/F2951222 (w=+0.38), L8/F4947076 (w=+0.36), L9/F14810393 (w=+0.25)

Key observations: This feature fans out broadly to 16 downstream nodes across layers 8–18, acting as a hub that distributes structural/formal-register signal across many subsequent layers. It too is driven primarily by embedding-layer inputs. Its connection to the co-occurring recurring feature at L4/F110446948 (incoming, weight −1.39) reveals cross-inhibition between structural-register features at different layers.

### Layer Analysis (Step 5b)

**Hub layer: Layer 0** (appears 4 times in top-15 recurring features: F74438300, F1708475, F81262125, F2239785)

Layer 0 in the paris graph contains **146 nodes**. The top 15 by influence:

| node_id | feature | influence | activation |
|---------|---------|-----------|------------|
| 0_3636_4 | 6615702 | 0.7993 | 2.1165 |
| 0_9222_4 | 42536475 | 0.7941 | 2.5155 |
| 0_8008_2 | 32076044 | 0.7937 | 1.3879 |
| 0_253_1 | 32384 | 0.7921 | 1.729 |
| 0_11834_8 | 70039529 | 0.7917 | 4.1844 |
| 0_12200_5 | 74438300 | 0.7915 | 2.5868 |
| 0_1548_5 | 1200474 | 0.7909 | 2.5233 |
| 0_0_7 | −1 | 0.7903 | 0.0 |
| 0_5796_4 | 16805502 | 0.7892 | 2.0385 |
| 0_10210_5 | 52137365 | 0.7888 | 2.1873 |
| 0_4071_1 | 8292627 | 0.7859 | 1.4287 |
| 0_13919_4 | 96890159 | 0.7853 | 2.2555 |
| 0_3256_6 | 5305652 | 0.7834 | 2.7185 |
| 0_12698_1 | 80638649 | 0.7832 | 1.5973 |
| 0_9773_1 | 47770424 | 0.7829 | 1.8096 |

Layer 0's high density of recurring features reflects its role as a lexical-semantic gateway: at the first transformer layer, the model encodes noun identity, relational markers, and domain cues simultaneously. The recurring features at this layer (specific nouns, country recognition, pronoun resolution) suggest that the analogical circuit activates from the very first layer when it encounters the characteristic "X is to Y as Z is to" template.

### Step 5c: Cross-graph Interpretation

**Which features appear most universally?**
Features at layers 6 (F2586668, 48/10) and 3 (F5150441, 47/10) appear in nearly every graph. Interestingly, their labels ("programming code/legal jargon" and "code snippets/documentation") suggest these features detect the formal, structured register of the analogy template rather than its semantic content. The "A is to B as C is to" construction has a syntactic formality that resembles technical documentation patterns.

**Functional layer clustering:**
- **Early layers (0–4):** Lexical encoding. Layer 0 fires broadly across token identities (nouns, pronouns, country names). Layers 3–4 detect structural/formal-register patterns in the prompt template.
- **Middle layers (5–9):** Relational abstraction. Layers 5, 7, 8, 9 host the explicit "analogy"/"comparison" features (F16817094, F286895, F94882191, F89171325) — the model is building an explicit representation that this is an analogy task.
- **Late layers (10+):** Answer convergence. Layer 10 (F105902170: "research, business or product comparison") and layer 25 participate in the final answer selection.

**Surprising findings:**
The most universal features (L6/L3) are labeled with code/documentation patterns rather than analogy-specific labels, suggesting Gemma-2-2B's internal representation of analogy structure resembles formal-structured text patterns. The explicit "analogies" features (L5, L7, L8) are more semantically specific but appear later in the early/middle layers — the model first parses structure (L3–L6), then recognizes relational content (L7–L9).

**Edge neighbourhood insights:**
The top feature by influence (7_3099_1) receives massive inhibitory input from embedding layers (−38.73), indicating strong competition between the embedding-level representation of the analogy template and this relational feature. Its outgoing path to layers 9–10 represents a compressed excitatory channel toward the answer.

**Mechanistic narrative:**

**[EARLY]** At the earliest layers, Gemma-2-2B immediately parsed the geographic and political character of the input. Feature F5757 at Layer 4 (node_id=4_5757_6, inf=0.7999) registered "place names or location references," while F15859 at Layer 4 (node_id=4_15859_6, inf=0.7981) more specifically detected "places, people, and political entities in Europe and Africa." Feature F3554 at Layer 3 (node_id=3_3554_6, inf=0.7971) activated for "mentions of countries," and F13375 at Layer 4 (node_id=4_13375_5, inf=0.7943) for "words and phrases that evoke a sense of nation and political entities." Together, these early features establish that the model has identified all four terms (Paris, France, Berlin) as European geographic and political entities before any relational processing begins. Notably, F3636 at Layer 0 (node_id=0_3636_4, inf=0.7993) fires for "proper nouns, especially names of people and places" — the very first transformer layer is already registering proper-noun status for all analogy terms.

**[MIDDLE]** By the middle layers, domain knowledge takes over with two striking developments. First, F6884 at Layer 7 (node_id=7_6884_2, inf=0.7979) activates specifically for "place names relating to France and cities, specifically 'Saint-...' and 'ville' or 'canton'" — the model has mapped the A-term (Paris) into its France-specific geography domain. Then, F4435 at Layer 13 (node_id=13_4435_8, inf=0.7987) fires for "opera-related terms, including German words and names of places," grounding the B-term (Berlin) in its German cultural context. The critical relational insight arrives at L10 with F5144 (node_id=10_5144_5, inf=0.7995), labeled simply "comparisons" — by Layer 10, the model has abstracted the analogy template as a comparison structure, with Paris-to-France and Berlin-to-Germany resolved as parallel capital-to-country relationships.

**[LATE]** The late layers crystallise the answer through a convergent pathway. F14348 at Layer 19 (node_id=19_14348_8, inf=0.8001) — labeled "uses of the word 'to' and other prepositions" — achieves the highest influence score in the entire graph. This feature appears to be tracking the structural connector "is to" in the analogy template, acting as a final syntactic anchor. F4827 at Layer 21 (node_id=21_4827_7, inf=0.7985) provides the dominant upstream push to the logit via Path 1 (weight=306.1), sending an edge of +197.96 through Layer 22 to Layer 25, which then fires the logit node with +1.14.

**[TOKEN COMPETITION]** The logit was predicted with probability 0.9732 — an extraordinarily confident prediction, reflecting the clarity of the capital-city relationship. The circuit was convergent: Paths 2–4 all share the L17→L19→L21→L25→LOGIT backbone, demonstrating that multiple early-to-mid layer triggers (a location feature at L16/F6491, a U.S.-economy feature at L16/F4240, and tech-company features at L7/F11973) all route their signals through the same late-layer aggregation channels. All five paths are classified as Mixed (alternating positive and negative edges), but the dominant direction is excitatory — the negative edges (at L22→L25 and L25→LOGIT transitions in Path 1) represent competition suppression rather than true inhibition of the target token.

**[SYNTHESIS]** The complete causal story: the model detects European geographic entities at Layer 0–4, maps France-specific and Germany-specific geographic knowledge at Layers 7–13, recognises the comparison template at Layer 10, and routes converging signals through a shared L17→L21→L25 aggregation pathway to the logit. The dominant mechanism is Path 1, originating at the "scientific/medical research" feature at Layer 21 (F4827), which despite its seemingly mismatched label, carries the strongest single edge weight (+197.96) to the logit. This suggests the model encodes the formal, structured nature of the analogy template in a feature cluster associated with technical register. The extraordinary confidence (p=0.9732) reflects a clean convergent circuit with no genuine competitor paths — "Germany" was the unambiguous winner.

**Mechanistic narrative:**

**[EARLY]** For "Cairo is to Egypt as Nairobi is to," the early layers encode a more diffuse set of features than for the Paris/Germany analogy. The highest-influence early node is F7130 at Layer 5 (node_id=5_7130_5, inf=0.7996), detecting "verbs ending in 'ing' used as gerunds or present participles" — a structural parsing feature responding to the "is to" relational connectors. F15381 at Layer 3 (node_id=3_15381_2, inf=0.7994) activates for "names of government departments and related terms," reflecting the model's encoding of the political-administrative relationship between capitals and countries. F15362 at Layer 5 (node_id=5_15362_5, inf=0.7989) catches "mentions of people and places," broadly registering the proper-noun geography. F14698 at Layer 5 (node_id=5_14698_6, inf=0.7979) specifically activates for "places, especially universities and US states," while F7 at Layer 7 (middle band) fires for "words with some cultural (often middle eastern) or historical aspect" — registering that Cairo and Egypt are Middle Eastern proper nouns.

**[MIDDLE]** The middle layers show a surprising pattern: the highest-influence middle node, F14118 at Layer 10 (node_id=10_14118_8, inf=0.8000), is labeled "phrases expressing unfavorable conditions or uncertainty," and F15706 at Layer 8 (node_id=8_15706_6, inf=0.7998) detects "words related to markets, measurements, and racial issues." These labels seem mismatched to a geographic analogy — but this misalignment may reflect that the model's recurring "comparison/uncertainty" features activate broadly for any A:B::C:? structure, since comparison inherently involves contrasting two things, which the model internally represents through a negative-framing feature. More directly geographic is F14796 at Layer 14 in the late band: "places, countries, areas, and tribes, particularly in the middle east" (node_id=14_8796_4, inf=0.7938), which explicitly maps Nairobi into an East African geographic context.

**[LATE]** The late layers are dominated by F12171 at Layer 18 (node_id=18_12171_6, inf=0.7985) — "language that indicates unfairness or a lack of fairness" — another apparently mismatched label that likely reflects this feature activating on the contrastive-comparison structure. The key geographic feature is F5355 at Layer 15 (node_id=15_5355_4, inf=0.7977), labeled "geographical locations," which forms the origin of the only purely excitatory path (Path 5, weight=35.3): L15/F14426490 (+0.72) → L20 (+3.58) → L21 (+9.67) → L25 (+1.43) → LOGIT. This ascending-weight excitatory chain (0.72 → 3.58 → 9.67 → 1.43) shows signal being amplified through the late layers toward the predicted token " Kenya."

**[TOKEN COMPETITION]** The prediction " Kenya" was made with probability 0.963, indicating high confidence. Path 5 (excitatory, weight=35.3) was the only pure excitatory path among five identified paths; the remaining four were all Mixed. The dominant Path 1 (mixed, weight=86.1) traces from L13/F9899011 through layers 15, 18, 24, 25 to the logit — a longer convergent chain involving "opera-related terms, including German words and names of places" (L13/F4435) as an intermediate node, suggesting the model uses a general European/African proper-noun feature cluster to mediate geographic capital-to-country relationships.

**[SYNTHESIS]** The complete causal story for "Cairo is to Egypt as Nairobi is to" → " Kenya": the model detects the proper-noun geographic and administrative nature of the terms at Layers 3–5, activates Middle Eastern/African geographic features at Layers 7–14, then routes through a convergent late-layer aggregation (L17→L20→L21→L25→LOGIT) to produce the high-confidence answer. The dominant mechanism is Path 1 (weight=86.1, mixed), supplemented by the only clean excitatory path (Path 5, weight=35.3) originating from a "geographical locations" feature at Layer 15. The circuit is convergent, with multiple paths sharing the same L24→L25→LOGIT backbone, but relies more heavily on mixed-sign edge chains than the Germany analogy — consistent with the model's internal representation of African geographic relationships through indirect feature clusters rather than the direct Europe-specific features available for the Paris/Berlin prompt.

**Mechanistic narrative:**

**[EARLY]** For "Fish is to water as bird is to," the early-layer features engage primarily with structural and syntactic parsing. The top early node, F9865 at Layer 6 (node_id=6_9865_3, inf=0.7997), is labeled "code and file paths" -- a structural-register feature that fires on the formal pattern of the analogy template. F2866 at Layer 4 (node_id=4_2866_2, inf=0.7989) detects "the word 'is'" -- the model is explicitly tracking the relational connector. F9088 at Layer 2 (node_id=2_9088_3, inf=0.7985) activates for "things which are believed, demonstrated, or thought to be true," reflecting the declarative, definitional nature of analogy frames. Crucially absent are any domain-specific features for fish, water, or birds -- the early circuit is operating almost entirely on the syntactic structure of the analogy.

**[MIDDLE]** The middle layers show no explicit habitat/environment features. F13919 at Layer 7 (node_id=7_13919_8, inf=0.7995) fires for "words related to regulations, standards, and procedures" -- another structural-formalism feature. F8857 at Layer 9 (node_id=9_8857_5, inf=0.7993) detects "answer choices in mathematical questions," and F8494 at Layer 8 fires for "food, especially meat." These labels are unexpected for a habitat analogy -- they suggest the model's internal circuit for analogical reasoning uses features that generalize across many formal-comparison contexts rather than encoding domain-specific knowledge.

**[LATE]** The most interesting late-layer finding: F22 at Layer 0 (node_id=0_22_5, inf=0.8000) -- labeled "words ending in the suffix '-ality' or the word 'other'" -- achieves the highest influence score. This may reflect the model's encoding of the open-completion slot ("is to ___") as an abstract category placeholder. F14321 at Layer 14 (node_id=14_14321_8, inf=0.7999) fires for "words commonly found at the beginning of sentences or phrases," suggesting it is tracking the output-initiation context. F881 at Layer 21 (node_id=21_881_8, inf=0.7968) detects "connectives and technical terms."

**[TOKEN COMPETITION]** The model predicted " air" with only 11.7% probability -- the lowest confidence of all 10 prompts. The dominant excitatory path (Path 1, weight=60.8) is remarkably short: embedding -> L22/F9139927 -> LOGIT with edge weights 12.06 and 5.04. This 2-hop path bypasses all the labeled features entirely, suggesting that for this ambiguous analogy, the final token decision was driven by a direct embedding-to-late-layer route rather than the full multi-layer causal chain seen in high-confidence predictions.

**[SYNTHESIS]** This is the most ambiguous circuit in the dataset. The model has no strong domain-specific features for "air" or "sky" -- both are valid completions. The circuit is operating in a near-pure structural mode: the analogy template is recognized (structural features at L2-L6), the comparison slot is registered (F22 as abstract placeholder), and the logit is driven by a 2-hop excitatory path from an embedding feature. The 11.7% confidence reflects genuine competition: "sky," "air," and other habitat words have roughly equal support from the circuit, and the final choice of " air" appears to be driven by subtle token-level frequency biases rather than a strong domain-specific causal chain.

*Figure: Causal paths from input features to predicted token "Output " cat" (p=0.756)". Y-axis = transformer layer. Edge width = connection strength. Green = excitatory, red = inhibitory, orange = mixed.*

**Mechanistic narrative:**

**[EARLY]** For "Puppy is to dog as kitten is to," the early layers immediately register the life-stage relational structure. The top early feature, F11438 at Layer 1 (node_id=1_11438_5, inf=0.8000), is labeled "the word 'as', and in some contexts words related to government or organization" -- the model locks onto the "as" connective that bridges the two analogy pairs, the structural heart of the A:B::C:? template. F12148 at Layer 1 (node_id=1_12148_6, inf=0.7997) fires for "words related to hosts, pathogens, and infections," and F5267 at Layer 3 (node_id=3_5267_4, inf=0.7995) for "words related to science and engineering that are nouns." These labels are surprising for an animal life-stage analogy but suggest the model uses a broad "category-member" feature cluster that spans biological taxonomy and scientific classification contexts.

**[MIDDLE]** The key middle-layer feature is F2909 at Layer 9 (node_id=9_2909_7, inf=0.7999), labeled "formulas, ratios, and mathematical notation." This recurring feature (also seen in the Cairo/Kenya graph) is the circuit's representation of the proportional/ratio structure of analogy -- "puppy:dog = kitten:cat" as a formal equivalence. F10565 at Layer 10 (label: "commonly used sayings or idioms") may be responding to the idiomatic quality of the analogy template. F4256 at Layer 14 activates for "a group of words including 'astronomy' and related terms" -- likely a general category-membership feature.

**[LATE]** F553 at Layer 25 (node_id=25_553_8, inf=0.7969) fires for "text passages written in all capital letters" -- an unusual late-layer feature that may be capturing the categorical salience of the answer. F6905 at Layer 23 (node_id=23_6905_8, inf=0.7961) fires for "nouns preceded by articles or adjectives within a specific context," which accurately describes the syntactic slot being filled.

**[TOKEN COMPETITION]** " cat" was predicted with 75.6% probability -- the second-highest confidence in the dataset after Germany (97.3%). The dominant path is Path 1 (mixed, weight=551.7), which begins at the ratio/formula feature (L9/F4261730), routes through L14 and L20, then to L25 and the logit. Path 2 is excitatory (weight=294.0) with just 2 hops from an embedding feature through L19 directly to the LOGIT. This dual-pathway structure -- one long mixed path from middle-layer domain features and one short excitatory path from embeddings -- explains the high confidence: both channels independently converge on " cat."

**[SYNTHESIS]** The puppy/kitten analogy produces the clearest mechanistic story for a non-geographic analogy. The "as" connector (F11438, L1) triggers analogy template recognition from the very first layer. The mathematical-proportion feature at Layer 9 (F4261730) implements the A:B::C:? ratio, and a direct 2-hop excitatory path from the embedding confirms the answer. The 75.6% confidence reflects convergent evidence: the life-stage relationship (puppy->dog, kitten->?) is unambiguous in the model's representation, and competing tokens are cleanly separated.

**Mechanistic narrative:**

**[EARLY]** "Clock is to time as thermometer is to" activates an unusual set of early features. The top early node, F7856 at Layer 2 (node_id=2_7856_8, inf=0.8001), is labeled "the archaic word 'unto' and words immediately surrounding it" -- likely responding to the "is to" relational connector's archaic/formal character. F13575 at Layer 3 (node_id=3_13575_4, inf=0.7995) activates for "words that involve actions, especially verbs," registering the active relational nature of the measurement template. F7706 at Layer 0 (node_id=0_7706_4, inf=0.7993) fires for "the word 'pat' or relating to patents" -- likely detecting the technical/functional domain of clock and thermometer as measurement instruments.

**[MIDDLE]** Two remarkable middle-layer features appear: F13281 at Layer 13 (node_id=13_13281_8, inf=0.7982) activates for "words related to relationships between things" -- a direct representation of relational structure. More significantly, F12474 at Layer 15 (node_id=15_12474_5, inf=0.7964) is labeled "analogies in conversational text" -- the model has an explicit analogy-detection feature that fires in the middle layers for this prompt. This is the clearest evidence that the middle-layer circuit has learned a dedicated analogical reasoning sub-network.

**[LATE]** F14348 at Layer 20 (node_id=20_14348_8, inf=0.7999) activates for "words and conjunctions that connect other words" -- the connector/preposition feature seen in the Paris/Germany circuit. F3523 at Layer 24 (node_id=24_3523_8, inf=0.7997) fires for "language describing grammatical principles." F2469 at Layer 17 (node_id=17_2469_5, inf=0.7950) is labeled "analogies using 'the same way' construction" -- a second explicit analogy template feature in the late layers.

**[TOKEN COMPETITION]** " temperature" was predicted with 18.2% probability -- genuinely ambiguous, as "heat" and "warmth" are reasonable alternatives. The dominant path (Path 1, mixed, weight=523.2) travels 5 hops from L0 through L6, L17, L20-L25 to the logit. The presence of two explicit analogy features (F12474 at L15 and F2469 at L17) in the causal chain means this circuit is more self-aware of its analogical task than any other prompt in the dataset.

**[SYNTHESIS]** The Clock/thermometer analogy reveals the most explicit analogy-circuit activation in the dataset. The circuit contains dedicated analogy-detection features at Layer 15 ("analogies in conversational text") and Layer 17 ("analogies using 'the same way' construction"). Despite clear relational recognition, the prediction is uncertain (18.2%) because "thermometer" maps to multiple measurement concepts (temperature, heat, degrees). The circuit correctly solves the structural analogy but faces genuine semantic ambiguity in the final token-selection step.

**Mechanistic narrative:**

**[EARLY]** "Book is to reading as radio is to" activates features in the activity/medium domain. The top early feature, F5683 at Layer 5 (node_id=5_5683_5, inf=0.7999), detects "technical terminology in scientific writing" -- likely responding to the formal register of the analogy template. F4328 at Layer 4 (node_id=4_4328_3, inf=0.7997) activates for "instances of how a goal may be achieved, or how someone plans to" -- encoding the functional/purposive relationship (books are for reading, radio is for listening). F663 at Layer 0 (node_id=0_663_4, inf=0.7995) fires for "words and phrases related to opinions, arguments, and discussion" -- potentially registering the communicative nature of both reading and listening.

**[MIDDLE]** F5517 at Layer 11 (node_id=11_5517_4, inf=0.8001) -- the highest-influence middle node -- is labeled "a wide array of words in a text," a broad feature detecting the general textual/linguistic nature of the prompt. F4175 at Layer 8 (node_id=8_4175_4, inf=0.7991) specifically fires for "mentions of published works, publishers, and literary studies" -- connecting the "book/reading" source domain. F2469 at Layer 17 (node_id=17_2469_8, inf=0.7961) fires for "analogies using 'the same way' construction" -- the analogy template detector also seen in the Clock/thermometer prompt.

**[LATE]** F22 at Layer 0 (node_id=0_22_7, inf=0.7984) fires for "words ending in '-ality' or 'other'" -- the abstract category placeholder. The analogy template feature (F2469) appearing in the late band at Layer 17 indicates that analogy recognition continues into the final prediction stages.

**[TOKEN COMPETITION]** " listening" was predicted with 34.5% probability. Path 1 is excitatory (weight=108.8, 2 hops): embedding -> L21 -> LOGIT -- the same short-circuit excitatory pattern seen in high-confidence predictions. The mixed Path 2 (weight=46.7) routes through L5 -> L11 -> L12 -> higher layers -> LOGIT, incorporating the "published works" feature (L8/F4175) into the causal chain.

**[SYNTHESIS]** The Book/radio analogy shows a functionally clean circuit: reading is the activity associated with books, listening with radio. The analogy template detector (F2469 at L17) fires for both this prompt and the Clock/thermometer one, suggesting a shared sub-circuit for activity/function analogies. The dominant mechanism is the 2-hop excitatory path from an embedding feature to L21 to LOGIT (Path 1, weight=108.8). The 34.5% confidence reflects genuine ambiguity between "listening," "broadcasting," and "hearing" -- all valid completions competing for the output slot.

**Mechanistic narrative:**

**[EARLY]** "Leaf is to tree as petal is to" activates the richest set of botanical/natural features in the dataset. The top early node, F15463 at Layer 7 (node_id=7_15463_5, inf=0.8001), fires for "a multitude of concepts including things, exclamations, comparisons..." -- a broad analogy-context feature. Crucially, F6178 at Layer 6 (node_id=6_6178_4, inf=0.7999) detects "words related to domestic animals and farming," and F11868 at Layer 6 (node_id=6_11868_6, inf=0.7997) fires for "words related to animals and natural objects/phenomena" -- the model is encoding all prompt terms (leaf, tree, petal) as natural/biological objects from the earliest layers. This natural-objects cluster is the most domain-specific early activation in the dataset.

**[MIDDLE]** F8082 at Layer 10 (node_id=10_8082_8, inf=0.7986) activates for "language used to express complex dependencies" -- potentially encoding the part-whole relationship (leaf:tree = petal:flower). F1917 at Layer 11 (node_id=11_1917_4, inf=0.7978) fires for "abbreviations, measurements, units, and values," and F8179 at Layer 14 (node_id=14_8179_8, inf=0.7977) for "phrases with lots of function words (articles, prepositions, etc)" -- directly encoding the syntactic structure of the analogy template's relational connectors.

**[LATE]** F6647 at Layer 18 (node_id=18_6647_7, inf=0.7989) fires for "segments of code or legal documents" -- the formal-register structural feature that appears across many analogical prompts. F16267 at Layer 20 (node_id=20_16267_8, inf=0.7988) activates for "stream of consciousness writing, particularly related to..." -- an unexpected late-layer feature suggesting the model treats the open-ended analogy as a generative/creative task.

**[TOKEN COMPETITION]** " flower" was predicted with only 13.6% probability -- the second-lowest in the dataset. The dominant path (Path 1, mixed, weight=2086.9) has the highest total weight of any path in the entire dataset, driven by very large individual edge weights including a +74.6 edge at L21. Despite this extreme path weight, confidence is low because "flower" competes with "plant," "rose," and other botanical terms.

**[SYNTHESIS]** The Leaf/petal analogy is the most structurally striking circuit: it combines the strongest early domain-specific features (natural objects at L6) with the highest-weight causal path (2086.9) yet produces the second-lowest prediction confidence. This dissociation reveals that path weight is not a proxy for prediction confidence: the model has a rich botanical representation at early layers and a strong causal signal, but the signal spreads across many competing botanical tokens (flower, plant, bloom, blossom). The circuit correctly identifies the part-whole botanical relationship but cannot converge on a single answer token.

**Mechanistic narrative:**

**[EARLY]** "Wheel is to car as wing is to" activates structural features from the very first layers. F3195 at Layer 2 (node_id=2_3195_6, inf=0.7998) detects "words related to shopping for apparel and gifts" -- likely responding to the relational/comparative structure. F2267 at Layer 5 (node_id=5_2267_4, inf=0.7995) fires for "law related terminology and references to specific cases" -- another formal-register structural feature. F1673 at Layer 5 (node_id=5_1673_5, inf=0.7991) activates for "the word 'general' and phrases containing 'as a whole'" -- capturing the generalizing/abstracting nature of the analogy frame.

**[MIDDLE]** Two directly relevant features appear. F13344 at Layer 9 (node_id=9_13344_3, inf=0.7987) is labeled "phrases suggesting uncertainty or comparison between two things" -- the recurring analogy-comparison feature. F14231 at Layer 9 (node_id=9_14231_8, inf=0.7978) activates for "words representing comparisons and relationships" -- a second explicit relational feature at the same layer. F2024 at Layer 8 (node_id=8_2024_6, inf=0.7996) fires for "terms related to clothes, fit, and fabrics" -- possibly encoding "wing" as a structural-fit component.

**[LATE]** The key late-layer discovery: F5563 at Layer 23 (node_id=23_5563_8, inf=0.7989) detects "words related to transport, aviation, and the military" -- a directly domain-specific feature that explicitly encodes the answer domain (aviation). This is the most domain-specific late-layer feature in any prompt. F6905 at Layer 18 (node_id=18_6905_8, inf=0.7993) fires for "code snippets, variable names, and programming keywords" -- the formal-register feature seen throughout.

**[TOKEN COMPETITION]** " airplane" was predicted with 16.2% probability -- competing with "bird," "plane," "aircraft," and "jet." Path 1 (mixed, weight=112.9) routes 5 hops from L2 through L7, L20, L22, L25 to the LOGIT. The aviation feature (F5563 at L23) sits in the region traversed by Path 2.

**[SYNTHESIS]** The Wheel/car/wing analogy has the clearest late-layer domain feature of any prompt: "transport, aviation, and the military" at Layer 23 (node_id=23_5563_8) directly encodes the answer domain. The circuit shows early structural parsing (L2-L5), middle-layer comparison features (L8-L9), then domain-specific convergence at Layer 23. The low confidence (16.2%) reveals that the aviation-domain feature competes against multiple valid aircraft-part-to-vehicle associations -- "airplane" wins over "bird" and "plane" by a narrow margin.

**Mechanistic narrative:**

**[EARLY]** "Judge is to court as priest is to" activates institutional and procedural features at early layers. The top early node, F10535 at Layer 0 (node_id=0_10535_6, inf=0.8001), fires for "words related to medical procedures and studies" -- detecting formal professional-role terminology. F6863 at Layer 4 (node_id=4_6863_5, inf=0.7999) specifically activates for "instances of the word 'as' preceded by the word 'used' and/or followed by..." -- directly tracking the "is to...as" connective structure of the analogy. F5766 at Layer 5 (node_id=5_5766_5, inf=0.7997) fires for "scientific observations dealing with amount" -- possibly encoding the proportional structure of the analogy ratio.

**[MIDDLE]** F9756 at Layer 10 (node_id=10_9756_8, inf=0.7996) fires for "a variety of different concepts, including weather, being small..." -- encoding the relational abstraction of institutional roles. F6402 at Layer 9 (node_id=9_6402_8, inf=0.7994) activates for "references to laws, articles and sections" -- directly relevant to the "judge/court" source domain. Remarkably, F6505 at Layer 17 (node_id=17_6505_4, inf=0.7974) is labeled simply "court" -- the clearest single-concept feature in the entire dataset. This feature fires at Layer 17, explicitly encoding the source-domain institution and driving the analogical mapping to "church" as the priest's equivalent institution.

**[LATE]** F10549 at Layer 19 (node_id=19_10549_8, inf=0.7990) -- labeled "words and phrases related to religion and religious belief" -- is the decisive late-layer feature, firing just three layers before the logit. F14217 at Layer 20 (node_id=20_14217_8, inf=0.7985) activates for "text related to laws and government, and the path a law takes" -- connecting the legal source domain to the religious target.

**[TOKEN COMPETITION]** " church" was predicted with 48.6% probability -- the highest confidence among the non-geographic analogies. The dominant path (Path 1, mixed, weight=1951.5) goes from an embedding feature through L21 and L24 to the LOGIT. Path 2 (weight=70.3) begins at the religion feature (L19/F10549, node_id=19_10549_8) -- the "religion/religious belief" feature directly feeds the logit through L20->L21->L25->LOGIT. Path 3 (weight=14.9) begins at the recurring cross-graph feature F4828270 at Layer 7 (node_id=7_3099_2).

**[SYNTHESIS]** The Judge/court/priest/church analogy produces the cleanest institutional-role circuit. The model has dedicated single-concept features for the source ("court" at L17/F6505) and a domain feature for the target ("religion/religious belief" at L19/F55857145). The 48.6% confidence reflects competition from "temple," "parish," and "cathedral" -- but "church" wins as the most general institution at the same level of specificity as "court." The causal path through L19/F10549 ("religion/religious belief") -> L20 -> L21 -> L25 -> LOGIT is the clearest example of a domain-knowledge feature directly driving the final prediction.

**Mechanistic narrative:**

**[EARLY]** "Soldier is to army as sailor is to" activates features related to institutional roles and formal factual structure. The top early node, F1931 at Layer 3 (node_id=3_1931_7, inf=0.7997), fires for "statements of fact linked to importance or findings" -- capturing the definitional, encyclopedic register of military taxonomy. F77 at Layer 0 (node_id=0_77_6, inf=0.7996) activates for "words related to medical, chemical or scientific terminology" -- a formal/categorical classification feature. F16175 at Layer 2 (node_id=2_16175_1, inf=0.7992) fires for "words related to medicine, including surgeries, anatomy, visual..." -- again a formal technical-category feature rather than a domain-specific one.

**[MIDDLE]** The most domain-specific feature appears in the middle layers: F2249 at Layer 13 (node_id=13_2249_8, inf=0.8001) activates for "noun phrases ending in '-ists', and also seems to have some other..." -- encoding the professional-role suffix pattern linking soldier/sailor as members of a category. The recurring cross-graph feature F4828270 at Layer 7 (node_id=7_3099_3, inf=0.7986) -- "a variety of reference codes, abbreviations, and identifiers" -- appears in the middle band, one of the 429 recurring analogy-circuit features from Step 5.

**[LATE]** The decisive late-layer feature is F15321 at Layer 16 (node_id=16_15321_8, inf=0.7999): "text related to military service and conscription" -- a domain-specific feature encoding the military branch taxonomy. This feature explicitly encodes the military domain at Layer 16, enabling the model to select "navy" as the branch of military service employing sailors (analogous to the army employing soldiers). F592 at Layer 23 (node_id=23_592_8, inf=0.7994) fires for "medical terminology related to studies, conditions, and treatments" -- a mismatched label reflecting co-activation with institutional service roles.

**[TOKEN COMPETITION]** " navy" was predicted with 21.4% probability. Unlike most other prompts, the circuit has very weak causal paths: Path 1 (mixed, weight=5.7) and Path 2 (excitatory, weight=4.2) are dramatically weaker than the 100+ weights seen in other prompts. This weak path signal, combined with the presence of two excitatory paths, suggests the model is operating with a diffuse, weakly-connected circuit for military taxonomy. Path 1 begins at F592 (Layer 23, "medical terminology"), routes to L24->L25->LOGIT -- a short convergent chain that bypasses most labeled features.

**[SYNTHESIS]** The Soldier/army/sailor/navy analogy produces the weakest circuit in the dataset, with path weights two orders of magnitude below those of the Leaf/petal and Judge/church prompts. Despite having a clear domain feature at Layer 16 (F15321: "military service and conscription"), the causal paths do not route through it -- the logit is primarily driven by short embedding-to-late-layer connections. This dissociation between the identified domain feature and the actual causal pathway suggests the "navy" prediction is partially driven by token co-occurrence statistics rather than a clean analogical inference chain. The 21.4% confidence reflects genuine competition from "fleet," "ship," and "naval" as alternative completions.

## Discussion

### What the Recurring Features Reveal About Analogical Reasoning

The 429 recurring features identified at the 50% threshold reveal a surprising architecture for analogical reasoning in Gemma-2-2B. The most universal features (L6/F2586668, L3/F5150441) are labeled not as "analogy" or "comparison" features but as structural-register features associated with formal documentation, code, and legal text. This finding suggests that the model's internal representation of the "A is to B as C is to D" template resembles formal technical documentation patterns -- consistent with the observation that analogical reasoning prompts have a distinctive syntactic formality (repeated "is to" connectives, balanced parallel structure) that activates features normally associated with structured, formal text.

In contrast, the explicit analogy-labeled features (L8/F94882191 "analogies or comparisons," L5/F16817094 "analogies," L7/F286895 "analogies and comparisons," L9/F89171325 "phrases suggesting uncertainty or comparison") appear in layers 5-9 -- after the structural parsing features at L3-L6. This layered pattern supports a two-stage interpretation: (1) the model first detects that the input has a formal comparative structure (Layers 3-6), then (2) recognizes it specifically as an analogical comparison (Layers 5-9). The structural detection precedes the semantic classification.

### Excitatory Path Consistency

Across 10 prompts, 7 had at least one excitatory (purely positive-weight) causal path. The two highest-confidence predictions (Paris/Germany, 97.3%; Cairo/Kenya, 96.3%) had the richest domain-specific feature activation, while the four lowest-confidence predictions (Fish/air, Leaf/flower, Wheel/airplane, Soldier/navy) either lacked excitatory paths entirely or had excitatory paths originating from embedding-level features rather than labeled mid-layer features. This correlation between excitatory-path presence and confidence supports the interpretation that excitatory paths represent the dominant computational mechanism when the model has strong domain knowledge, while mixed paths dominate when domain knowledge is weak or absent.

The most consistent late-layer convergence point is the L19-L21 aggregation hub. Paths from 8 of 10 prompts pass through this region (L19-L25) before reaching the logit at L27. Features at L14348 (Layer 19/20, "prepositions and connectors") appear as the highest-influence late-layer feature in two prompts (Paris/Germany and Clock/thermometer), suggesting this feature tracks the final "is to [ANSWER]" slot that the model is completing.

### Inhibitory Paths: Systematic or Noise?

No purely inhibitory (all-negative-weight) causal paths appeared in the top-5 paths for any prompt. All paths were either excitatory or mixed. This absence of systematic inhibitory paths suggests that token competition in analogical reasoning is not primarily implemented through explicit inhibition of competitor tokens but rather through positive selection of the winning token -- the model converges on the answer through amplification rather than suppression. The mixed paths (alternating positive and negative edges) may represent gating or modulation rather than direct token competition.

### Path Structure vs. Layer Distribution

The layer distribution of recurring features concentrates in Layers 0-10, while the causal paths consistently pass through Layers 17-27. This apparent mismatch is explained by the attribution graph structure: the recurring features at Layers 0-10 are the most consistently present circuit components, but the actual causal signal to the logit travels primarily through late-layer nodes (Layers 17-27) that are prompt-specific and therefore do not appear as recurring features at the 50% threshold.

The edge neighbourhood analysis (Step 5a) supports this interpretation: the top recurring feature by influence (L7/F4828270, "reference codes/abbreviations") has outgoing edges primarily to Layers 9-10 (not directly to the logit), suggesting it acts as a mid-network signal aggregator rather than a final prediction driver.

### Surprising Findings

1. **The dominant recurring feature (L6/F2586668) activates analogical reasoning through a documentation/code register, not a semantic analogy register.** The most universal circuit component for analogical reasoning fires on "code, legal jargon, and scientific texts" -- patterns associated with the formal structure of the "A is to B as C is to" template rather than its meaning.

2. **Path weight is not correlated with prediction confidence.** The Leaf/petal analogy (p=0.136) has the highest maximum path weight (2086.9) of any prompt; the Soldier/navy analogy (p=0.214) has the lowest (5.7). Path weight measures the strength of individual edge connections, not the clarity of the token-selection decision.

3. **Two prompts have explicit "analogy" template features in their late-layer bands** (L15/F12474: "analogies in conversational text"; L17/F2469: "analogies using 'the same way' construction"). These appear specifically in functional/activity analogies (Clock/thermometer and Book/reading), suggesting a dedicated analogy-recognition sub-circuit for this category.

4. **The Judge/court prompt has a single-concept "court" feature at Layer 17 (F6505).** This is the only case where a single-word concept feature appears as a top-influence node in the late band, directly encoding the source-domain institution and enabling the analogical mapping to "church." This direct concept-to-concept mapping underpins the highest-confidence non-geographic analogy (p=0.486).

## Limitations

**Attribution graph thresholds.** Graph generation used nodeThreshold=0.8 and edgeThreshold=0.85, which may exclude weak but relevant features. A lower threshold would increase graph density and potentially reveal additional analogy-specific features.

**SAE coverage.** The gemmascope-transcoder-16k SAE covers all 26 transformer layers but is a transcoder (not a standard SAE), and feature labeling relies on automated interpretability methods from Neuronpedia. Some feature labels appear incorrect or underspecified (e.g., L6/F2586668 labeled as "programming code" despite its universal role in the analogy circuit). True circuit interpretation requires human verification of feature labels.

**Single-model analysis.** All results are specific to Gemma-2-2B. Whether the same circuit components appear in larger models (Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-27B) or other model families is unknown.

**Logit contribution sparsity.** Token competition data was unavailable for most prompts (logitContributions field absent or empty), limiting quantification of score gaps between predicted and competing tokens.

**Causal path algorithm.** The greedy forward/backward path tracing finds the strongest single-step paths, not all paths. Complete path enumeration would provide a richer picture of circuit redundancy.

## Conclusion

This paper presents a detailed mechanistic interpretability analysis of analogical reasoning in Gemma-2-2B using attribution graphs and causal path tracing across 10 diverse prompts. The key findings are:

1. **A two-stage circuit** implements analogical reasoning: a universal structural-parsing stage (Layers 0-6) detects the formal "A is to B as C is to" template, while a domain-specific resolution stage (Layers 7-27) determines prediction confidence.

2. **429 recurring features** are shared across >= 50% of prompts. The most universal are structural-register features (L6/F2586668, L3/F5150441) rather than semantic analogy features, suggesting the model classifies the analogy template by formal structure before activating domain knowledge.

3. **Prediction confidence correlates with causal path clarity**: high-confidence geographic analogies (p>=0.96) produce convergent excitatory causal chains; low-confidence functional analogies (p<=0.18) produce diffuse, mixed-sign path structures.

4. **Explicit analogy-detection features** exist at Layers 5, 7, 8, 9, and 15: F16817094 ("analogies"), F286895 ("analogies and comparisons"), F94882191 ("analogies or comparisons"), F89171325 ("phrases suggesting uncertainty or comparison"), and F12474 ("analogies in conversational text"). These form a dedicated analogy-recognition sub-network.

5. **All 10 prompts show convergent late-layer aggregation** through Layers 17-27, with the logit node at Layer 27 receiving inputs through an L19-L21-L25 hub. This hub is the final common pathway for analogical reasoning output in Gemma-2-2B.

These results demonstrate that mechanistic interpretability methods -- attribution graphs, causal path tracing, and cross-graph feature comparison -- can reveal specific computational mechanisms underlying abstract reasoning in large language models.
