## Abstract

We present a mechanistic analysis of analogical reasoning in Gemma-2-2B using Neuronpedia attribution graphs . The graphs cover different analogies ranging from geography (*Paris - France → Berlin - ?*, *Rome - ?*, *Tokyo - ?*) to semantic roles (*Doctor - hospital → teacher - ?*, *Fish - water → bird - ?*). We identify a shared **analogical reasoning circuit** comprising 180 features active across all five prompts and 510 features active across at least three. Each feature is identified by a pair *layer, feature index* , identifying circuits as lists of recurring internal model feature activation patterns, that retain similar structure across prompts.

We discover dedicated analogy-encoding features at layers 5, 8, 9, and 13, including a feature at layer 5 labeled literally as **"analogies"** and a layer 8 feature encoding **"analogies or comparisons"** appearing across all graphs with high influence. Early layers (0–4) contain circuit templates tracking the "X is to Y as Z is to" pattern, while mid-to-late layers (5–13) provide increasingly semantic representations of the relational structure. The circuit spans all 26 transformer layers and exhibits cross-domain generalization, with the same core features activating for both geographic and semantic role analogies. Causal validation via 159 feature steering experiments confirms that the identified backbone features are collectively necessary for the model's predictions, as suppressing all backbone features simultaneously disrupts correct predictions across nearly all circuits. Furthermore, Phase 2 features collectively implement the relational transfer operation that is the computational core of analogical reasoning, as suppressing only the four Phase 2 features causes capital analogy circuits to output 'France' rather than the correct target country.

## 1. Introduction

Analogical reasoning — the ability to recognize and complete structural relationships between concepts — is a foundational cognitive ability underlying scientific discovery, language understanding, and abstract problem solving. The classic analogy task, *"Paris is to France as Berlin is to \_\_\_\_,"* tests whether a model can identify the capital-city relationship and apply it to a new country. Large language models (LLMs) exhibit striking competence on such tasks [1], yet the internal computational mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Mechanistic interpretability research has made significant progress in understanding factual recall circuits [2], indirect object identification [3], and syntactic processing [4]. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a central tool in this effort, learning sparse, interpretable decompositions of model activations [5, 6] that can be applied at scale across all layers and sublayers of large models [7]. The Neuronpedia platform [8] provides this infrastructure, through a web platform and public APIs for attribution graph generation, feature steering and circuit-level analysis, without need for direct model access.

Analogical reasoning presents a distinct challenge for the model's knowledge retrieval and feature activation: it requires not merely retrieving a stored fact, but recognizing a **relational structure** and applying it compositionally to novel inputs. The relation type is never named in the prompt — the model must infer *capital-of* from the example alone, hold it as a variable, and transfer it to a new argument pair. Prior work has documented that LLMs exhibit apparently emergent analogical reasoning [1] and identified internal attention-head mechanisms supporting abstract reasoning [9], yet a feature-level, causally-validated circuit account has been absent.

We utilize the Neuronpedia functionality to explore analogical reasoning in attribution graphs generated from the `gemmascope-transcoder-16k` SAE suite [7], which provides cross-layer transcoder features for every layer of Gemma-2-2B. Our analysis identifies a three-phase circuit with explicitly labeled analogy-concept features, provides causal validation through 159 steering experiments, and constitutes a mechanistic account of analogical reasoning in a large language model. The four central research questions we address are: (1) whether Gemma-2-2B employs a **shared circuit** for analogical reasoning or different mechanisms for different analogy types; (2) which SAE features — identified by stable *(layer, feature index)* pairs — are most **consistently activated** across diverse analogical prompts; (3) whether there exist interpretable, semantically meaningful features that encode the **abstract relational structure** of analogies and how they are discovered; and (4) how the analogical computation is **distributed across transformer layers** and whether phase boundaries can be causally validated.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Prompt Selection

We selected five prompts spanning two structural analogy types to ensure cross-domain coverage. The three capital-type prompts are: `analog_berlin` (*"Paris is to France as Berlin is to"*, expected: Germany), `analog_rome` (*"Paris is to France as Rome is to"*, expected: Italy), and `analog_tokyo` (*"Paris is to France as Tokyo is to"*, expected: Japan). The two semantic role prompts are: `analog_teacher` (*"Doctor is to hospital as teacher is to"*, expected: school) and `analog_bird` (*"Fish is to water as bird is to"*, expected: air / sky). The ID strings serve as slug names in Neuronpedia API calls and as row labels throughout the result tables.

### 2.2 Attribution Graph Generation

Attribution graphs were generated using the Neuronpedia API [8] (`/api/graph/generate`) with Gemma-2-2B and the `gemmascope-transcoder-16k` SAE [7] — a 26-layer cross-layer transcoder with 16,384 features per layer. Each graph request returns a JSON object containing nodes (SAE feature activations with layer, index, influence score, and activation magnitude) and directed edges (attribution scores). Graphs were downloaded and loaded into NetworkX `DiGraph` objects for analysis. The generation parameters were: model `gemma-2-2b`; SAE `gemmascope-transcoder-16k`; maximum feature nodes 3,000; desired logit probability 0.95; node threshold 0.80; edge threshold 0.85. A key technical finding during implementation was that the correct API endpoint for `gemmascope-transcoder-16k` requires a layer-prefixed SAE identifier (e.g., `4-gemmascope-transcoder-16k` for layer 4) rather than the global SAE name; initial calls using the global name returned HTTP 404 errors.

### 2.3 Feature Identification and Cross-Graph Analysis

Each feature in the attribution graphs is identified by a stable *(layer, feature index)* pair — for example, *(5, 5793)* uniquely and persistently identifies a feature within the `gemmascope-transcoder-16k` SAE [7]. These identifiers are fixed properties of the trained SAE and do not vary across prompts, sessions, or API calls.

Cross-graph feature overlap was computed by finding which *(layer, feature index)* pairs appear as nodes across multiple independently generated graphs. Formally, let $G_i$ denote the set of feature IDs active in graph $i$. The shared circuit at threshold $k$ is:

$$\mathcal{C}_k = \left\{ f \;\middle|\; \sum_{i=1}^{5} \mathbf{1}[f \in G_i] \geq k \right\}$$

Three thresholds were analyzed: $k \in \{3, 4, 5\}$. The 180-feature core circuit ($k=5$) is therefore a concrete, enumerable list of *(layer, feature index)* identifiers that recur across all five independently generated graphs regardless of whether the prompt is geographic or semantic in nature. Feature labels were retrieved using the Neuronpedia feature explanation API [8].

### 2.4 Three-Phase Architecture: How Phase Boundaries Were Identified

The three-phase architecture was identified through two converging lines of evidence, neither of which required the authors to impose phase boundaries a priori.

**Evidence 1: Feature labels naturally cluster by layer depth.**
After retrieving Neuronpedia automated labels for the top recurring features, a consistent gradient emerged across layer depth — not imposed by the authors, but revealed by the labels themselves:

- **Layers 0–5** carry structural template labels ("the word 'to'", "'to' followed by a verb", "the phrase 'it is to'"). These features are not merely grammatical — they are parsing the *skeleton* of the analogy prompt itself. Looking at a prompt like *"Paris is to France as Rome is to"*, these features track the relational connectives that signal a comparison is being drawn and that a completion is expected. The model is learning the *shape* of the problem before it understands what the problem is about.

- **Layers 5–9** carry explicitly relational-semantic labels ("analogies", "analogies or comparisons", "comparison between two things"). This is where the model transitions from recognizing the format to recognizing the *concept* — it now understands that what it is doing is an analogy, regardless of whether the content is geographic (Berlin, Rome, Tokyo) or semantic (teacher, bird).

- **Layers 10–13** carry integrative labels ("comparisons between disciplines and relationships between concepts"). This is where the model shifts from recognizing 
the relational structure in the abstract to thinking about it in domain-specific terms — for a capital analogy it begins reasoning within the space of countries 
and capitals, for a semantic role analogy within the space of professions and their environments. The model is not yet predicting the answer, but it is 
narrowing down *what kind of thing* the answer will be.

The phase boundaries therefore emerge from the content of the labels rather than an arbitrary partition of layers. The following shows one representative feature per phase — inspect each to see the activation patterns that characterize that phase:

<iframe src="https://www.neuronpedia.org/list/cmoo9aq4m0001421tihqebmc2?embed=true" title="Three-Phase Analogical Reasoning Circuit" style="height: 400px; width: 100%;"></iframe>

**Evidence 2: Activation magnitudes accumulate monotonically across phases.**
Average activation magnitudes of core features increase steadily through the phases, as shown in Table 1. Structural template features at L0 fire weakly (1.5–6.4); analogy and comparison features at L5–L9 fire more strongly (7.4–13.4); and relational integration features at L10–L13 reach the highest magnitudes (9.1–16.3). This pattern is consistent with an accumulating signal — each phase building on the previous one — rather than independent per-layer computation.

This three-stage organization mirrors the emergent symbolic architecture documented by Webb et al. [9] for abstract reasoning more broadly, where early layers abstract tokens into relational variables, intermediate layers perform induction over those variables, and later layers retrieve the answer.

| Phase                  | Layer Range | Role                                        | Activation Magnitude |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Structural template    | L0–L4       | Parsing the shape and format of the analogy | 1.5 – 6.4            |
| Analogy recognition    | L5–L9       | Recognizing the relational concept itself   | 7.4 – 13.4           |
| Relational integration | L10–L13     | Combining relation with domain knowledge    | 9.1 – 16.3           |

### 2.5 Discovery of Analogy-Concept Features

The most striking finding of the cross-graph analysis was not planned — it emerged from the data. The key features — L5 SAE#5793 ("analogies"), L8 SAE#13766 ("analogies or comparisons"), and L9 SAE#13344 ("phrases suggesting uncertainty or comparison between two things") — were not specifically sought. They emerged from the cross-graph overlap analysis described in Section 2.3. Once the intersection feature set was computed, each feature's automated Neuronpedia explanation [8] was retrieved.

The significance of these labels is their domain-agnosticism: all three features appear in attribution graphs for Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo (geographic capital analogies) and for teacher and bird (semantic role analogies). This is consistent with the broader finding in the analogical reasoning literature that LLMs encode relational information in a domain-general manner [10, 11], and extends that behavioral finding to specific, causally-validated internal features. To illustrate, Figures 1a and 1b show L9 SAE#13344 and L8 SAE#13766 respectively, each captured inside the attribution graph UI for the *teacher* prompt — one representative from the five. The complete set of both features across all five prompts is provided in Appendix A.

### 2.6 Circuit Definition and Causal Validation via Feature Steering

A circuit for a given prompt is defined as the backbone of causally important features in that prompt's attribution graph. The extraction procedure is identical for all prompts: trace the top-5 causal paths backward from the logit node (greedy walk following highest-weight incoming edges) and the top-5 paths forward from the highest-influence embedding nodes. Any transcoder feature appearing on at least one of these 10 paths is a backbone member. This procedure is analogous to the automated circuit discovery approach of Conmy et al. [4], applied here at the SAE feature level rather than the attention head level.

Causal validation was performed using the Neuronpedia `/api/steer` endpoint [8] with `modelId: "gemma-2-2b"` and `strength_multiplier: 4`. Four experimental paradigms were applied: (1) necessity by individual suppression, in which a single backbone feature is suppressed at strength −20; (2) necessity by full backbone suppression, in which all backbone features are suppressed simultaneously; (3) sufficiency via hub boost, in which a backbone hub feature is boosted at strength +20 on altered prompts; and (4) specificity testing via non-backbone suppression, in which high-activation features not on any causal path are suppressed. Two additional circuits from an expanded 30-prompt analysis (Cairo→Kenya, Puppy→cat) were included for cross-validation, for a total of **159 individual steering API calls across 7 circuits**.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Graph Structure

All five attribution graphs exhibited a consistent structural pattern, with features activated across all 26 transformer layers (0–25) plus the embedding layer (E). The `analog_berlin` graph contains 930 nodes and 25,915 edges (max influence 0.8001); `analog_rome` 963 nodes and 27,608 edges (0.8002); `analog_tokyo` 905 nodes and 22,414 edges (0.8001); `analog_teacher` 1,040 nodes and 35,481 edges (0.8001); and `analog_bird` 1,071 nodes and 38,741 edges (0.8000). The semantic role analogies (*teacher*, *bird*) have notably larger graphs (1,040–1,071 nodes, 35k–38k edges) compared to the capital analogies (905–963 nodes, 22k–27k edges). We interpret this as reflecting greater ambiguity in the expected completion domain: the *capital-of* relation maps to a discrete, well-encoded fact [2], whereas professional and ecological roles require broader world-knowledge access.

### 3.2 The Core Analogical Reasoning Circuit

Cross-graph feature overlap analysis over the stable *(layer, feature index)* identifier space revealed a substantial shared circuit. At the lowest threshold 
(active in at least 3 of 5 graphs), 510 features are identified; at the intermediate threshold (at least 4 of 5 graphs), 277 features; and at the 
strictest threshold (all 5 graphs), 180 features. The 180-feature shared circuit is the focus of our analysis.

To understand where the most meaningful contributions live, we ranked all 180 recurring features by influence score and examined the top 50. As shown in 
Figure 2, early layers dominate — L0 contributes 12 and L1–L4 contribute 19, reflecting that all five prompts share the same "X is to Y as Z is to" syntactic 
structure, making these layers naturally active across every prompt. The L5–L6 layers maintain 12 high-influence recurring features despite being a narrow layer 
range — these are the **analogy recognition hub** layers where the model transitions from structural parsing to relational concept recognition. L8–L13 
contributes only 7 features among the top 50, but retrieving their Neuronpedia labels revealed they carry the highest semantic specificity — explicitly encoding analogical and relational concepts such as "analogies or comparisons" and "comparisons between disciplines and relationships between concepts."

### 3.3 The Three-Phase Analogical Reasoning Circuit

We provide evidence that Gemma-2-2B performs genuine multi-step analogical reasoning internally. The attribution graph reveals a three-phase computational process that activates for both geographic and semantic role analogies — evidence of a domain-agnostic relational reasoning mechanism. This three-stage organization parallels the symbolic architecture identified by Webb et al. [9] through causal mediation analysis and the internal representation findings of Lee et al. [10].

**Phase 1 (layers 0–4): Circuit Template Parsing.** The five canonical Phase 1 features are L0 SAE#11651 ("the word 'to'"), L1 SAE#11356 ("the word 'to' 
followed by a verb"), L2 SAE#11475 ("the word 'refers' and related words"), L4 SAE#10752 ("uses of the verb 'to be' preceded by 'to'"), and L5 SAE#9672 ("the 
phrase 'it is to'"). These features encode the syntactic skeleton of the analogy prompt — "Paris **is to** France **as** Rome **is to**". Their progression from 
individual tokens to multi-word patterns reflects hierarchical parsing of the relational connective that is unique to the analogy format. The model is not 
processing generic grammar here — it is tracking the precise structural markers that signal a comparison is being drawn and a completion is expected.

**Phase 2 (layers 5–9): Analogy Recognition Hub.** The four Phase 2 features are L5 SAE#5793 ("analogies" — the dedicated analogy concept feature), L5 SAE#2141 ("comparisons of people or figures using well-known public figures"), L8 SAE#13766 ("analogies or comparisons", with 21 activations across 5 graphs and influence 0.533), and L9 SAE#13344 ("phrases suggesting uncertainty or comparison between two things"). This is where circuit template processing gives way to semantic recognition of the relational concept itself. The presence of L5 SAE#5793, labeled "analogies" by Neuronpedia's automated SAE feature explanation system [8], is particularly significant: it activates consistently for both capital-city and semantic role analogies. It is not a geographic feature — it fires equally for "Doctor - hospital → teacher - ?". This is direct evidence of the kind of abstract relational representation that prior behavioral work [1, 11] has hypothesized but not directly observed inside a model.

**Phase 3 (layers 10–13): Relational Integration.** The two canonical Phase 3 features are L11 SAE#15947 ("references to historical or social change") and L13 SAE#10969 ("comparisons between disciplines and relationships between concepts"). L13 SAE#10969 serves an integrative role, combining the recognized relational structure from Phase 2 with domain-specific knowledge to produce the final completion. Layers 14–25 then handle domain-specific knowledge retrieval and output token formatting, analogous to the factual recall circuits identified by Meng et al. [2].

> **Note:** This description simplifies the true mechanisms considerably. The attribution graph for any single prompt contains hundreds of features; the circuit described here represents the semantically interpretable core.

### 3.4 Top Recurring Features

The top recurring features fall into three functional categories. The five directly analogical features, whose Neuronpedia labels explicitly reference analogical reasoning or comparison, are: L5 #5793 (11 appearances across 5 graphs, avg. influence 0.590, "analogies"), L8 #13766 (21/5, 0.533, "analogies or comparisons"), L9 #13344 (14/5, 0.681, "comparison between two things"), L5 #2141 (12/5, 0.647, "comparisons of public figures"), and L13 #10969 (11/5, 0.676, "comparisons between disciplines"). The five circuit template features, which encode the "X is to Y as Z is to" scaffold, are: L0 #11651 (10/5, 0.633, "the word 'to'"), L1 #11356 (10/5, 0.609, "'to' followed by a verb"), L2 #11475 (10/5, 0.638, "the word 'refers'"), L4 #10752 (10/5, 0.626, "'to be' preceded by 'to'"), and L5 #9672 (12/5, 0.579, "the phrase 'it is to'"). Finally, three high-recurrence formal text features with labels unrelated to analogical reasoning are: L4 #14857 (22/5, 0.681, "code snippets and license agreements"), L6 #2267 (20/5, 0.724, "words in programming code, legal jargon, or scientific texts"), and L3 #3205 (20/5, 0.670, "code snippets and documentation references"). These formal-text features have higher raw appearance counts than the explicitly analogical features. Causal steering (Section 3.7.6) confirms they are inert for all high-confidence circuits, consistent with their role as detectors of syntactic formality rather than relational semantics. The polysemanticity of neurons in large models [6] is precisely why SAE-based feature decomposition [5, 6, 7] is necessary to distinguish these classes of activation.

### 3.5 Cross-Domain Generalization

The consistent activation of L5 SAE#5793 ("analogies") and L8 SAE#13766 ("analogies or comparisons") across both capital-city and semantic role analogy types provides the most direct evidence for a **domain-general analogical reasoning mechanism**. The 180 features active in all five graphs form the stable intersection of the two analogy type families, and this intersection includes the core analogy-concept features at L5 and L8. The slightly larger graphs for semantic role analogies (teacher, bird: 1,040–1,071 nodes) relative to capital analogies (Berlin, Rome, Tokyo: 905–963 nodes) may reflect that semantic role completions require broader world-knowledge access — knowing that teachers work in schools, or that birds inhabit air — rather than purely relational computation over a discrete, well-encoded geographic fact [2].


### 3.6 Circuit Stability Across Scaled and Syntactically Diverse Prompts

To validate that the shared circuit identified in Section 3.1 is not an artifact of using only five similar prompts, an extensive scaling experiment was performed. The central question is this: if we keep adding new analogical prompts — including versions phrased very differently from the original format — do the same features keep showing up?

The experiment generated attribution graphs for 50 prompts in total. Crucially, from the second batch onward, the prompts were not just new examples of the same template — they were rephrased into three syntactically distinct surface forms alongside the original:

| Surface Form | Example |
|---|---|
| Standard X-to-Y | `Paris is to France as Berlin is to` |
| Diverse-A (Just as…) | `Just as Paris is the capital of France, Berlin is the capital of` |
| Diverse-B (Found in…) | `Doctors are found in hospitals. Teachers are found in` |
| Diverse-C (The way…) | `The way a fish lives in water, a bird lives in` |

These four forms look very different on the surface — different word order, different connectives, no shared "is to … as" string. If the circuit from Section 3.1 were merely tracking surface tokens, it would fall apart when these diverse forms were introduced.

At each milestone (N = 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50), the strictest possible threshold was applied: a feature must appear in **every single** attribution graph at that point. The results are shown below.

| N | Recurring features (k = ALL) | Drop from previous |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | **180** | — |
| 10 | **116** | −64 (−35.6 %) |
| 20 | **86** | −30 (−25.9 %) |
| 30 | **77** | −9 (−10.5 %) |
| 40 | **70** | −7 (−9.1 %) |
| 50 | **67** | −3 (−4.3 %) |

![Figure S1: Scaling curve showing the number of features that recur across ALL N attribution graphs as N grows from 5 to 50. The curve drops steeply at first — removing features that only appeared by coincidence in the small prompt set — then nearly plateaus, converging to a stable floor of 67 features.](scaling_curve.png)

The curve has a clear two-phase shape. First, a **rapid contraction** from N = 5 to N = 20: adding the first batch of syntactically diverse prompts eliminates roughly half the initial 180 features. This is expected — features that appeared in every one of the original five prompts by coincidence, or because all five shared the "is to … as" surface string, do not survive once fundamentally different phrasings are added. Second, a **near-plateau** from N = 20 onward: only 19 further features are lost across 30 additional prompts, and the final step (N = 40 → 50) removes just 3. By N = 50, the curve has essentially stopped moving.

This convergence behaviour is the key result. The 67-feature core at N = 50 survived 50 prompts spanning two semantic domains, four surface forms, and a strict all-or-nothing threshold. That is not noise — it is a stable circuit.

**The five directly analogical features all survive.** Within the 67-feature core, five features carry Neuronpedia labels that explicitly describe analogical or comparative reasoning. Every one of them appears in all 50 attribution graphs:

| Feature | Appearances | Avg. Influence | Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| L13 #10969 | 62 | 0.713 | "comparisons between disciplines and relationships between concepts" |
| L9 #13344 | 116 | 0.683 | "phrases suggesting uncertainty or comparison between two things" |
| L9 #14231 | 53 | 0.683 | "words representing comparisons and relationships" |
| L7 #749 | 80 | 0.652 | "analogies and comparisons" |
| L5 #2141 | 62 | 0.639 | "comparisons of people or figures using well-known public figures" |

Three of these — L13 #10969, L9 #13344, and L5 #2141 — were already identified in the original five-prompt analysis (Section 3.4). The scaling experiment adds two new ones: L9 #14231 ("words representing comparisons and relationships") and L7 #749 ("analogies and comparisons"), which only become visible once the prompt set is large and diverse enough to filter out coincidental co-activations. All five span the analogy recognition and relational integration phases (Sections 3.4 and 3.5).

Despite the 50 prompts being phrased four different ways, the model consistently activated the same five semantic features. This confirms that the circuit is not reading a surface token pattern — it is recognising the underlying relational structure of an analogy, regardless of how that structure is expressed in words.

### 3.7 Causal Validation via Feature Steering

The attribution graph analysis identifies recurring features and causal path structures but does not by itself establish whether these features are causally necessary for the model's predictions. To distinguish load-bearing circuit components from high-activation but functionally inert nodes, we performed systematic causal steering experiments via the Neuronpedia API [8].

#### 3.7.1 Late-Layer Backbone Necessity (Individual Suppression)

For `analog_berlin` ("Paris is to France as Berlin is to" → Germany, p=0.973), nine backbone features were tested. The science hub at L21/4827 (strongest path entry, edge +198.0), relay at L22/15670, output driver A at L25/4717 (final amplifier, shared across circuits), location encoder at L16/6491, relay at L17/14546, relay at L19/5773, integrator at L21/7482 (integration hub, paths 2–4), and relation applier at L19/855 all returned "Germany" when suppressed individually — none necessary. Only output driver B at L25/2725 (secondary output driver, edge −2.09) is individually necessary, producing "the" when suppressed. **1/9 necessary.** The highest-weight feature (L21/4827, edge +198.0) is not individually necessary, demonstrating that attribution weight alone does not predict causal necessity — a key methodological lesson consistent with prior circuit analysis work [3, 4].

| Feature          | Layer | Index | Role                                     | Steered Token | Necessary? |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Science hub      | 21    | 4827  | Strongest path entry (edge +198.0)       | Germany       | no         |
| Relay            | 22    | 15670 | Path 1 relay                             | Germany       | no         |
| Output driver A  | 25    | 4717  | Final amplifier (shared across circuits) | Germany       | no         |
| Location encoder | 16    | 6491  | Location/direction feature, path 2 entry | Germany       | no         |
| Relay            | 17    | 14546 | Mid-cascade relay                        | Germany       | no         |

For `analog_rome` ("Paris is to France as Rome is to" → Italy, p=0.974), ten features were tested. The relay at L20/15360, relays at L22/12202 and L22/14727, relay at L23/5917, and secondary gate at L24/13277 all returned "Italy." Four features are individually necessary: late gate at L24/16122 ("the"), output driver at L25/286 ("the"), final amplifier at L25/4717 ("the"), and output driver C at L25/10521 ("the"). **4/10 necessary.** The Rome circuit has more single points of failure than Berlin despite near-identical confidence (p=0.974 vs 0.973), indicating path redundancy varies even among structurally similar geographic analogies.

For `analog_tokyo` ("Paris is to France as Tokyo is to" → Japan, p=0.990), ten features were tested and three found necessary: output driver at L25/286 ("the"), late relay A at L23/850 ("the"), and late relay B at L23/13914 ("the"). **3/10 necessary.** L23/13914 is necessary in both Tokyo and Cairo circuits — a shared bottleneck consistent with a late-layer "geographic entity selector" role. L25/286 recurs as necessary in Rome, Tokyo, and Cairo, making it the single most critical output driver across geographic analogies.

For `analog_teacher` ("Doctor is to hospital as teacher is to" → school, p=0.486), ten features were tested and three found necessary: the embedding-level feature at L0/17 ("the"), output driver at L25/4975 ("..."), and final amplifier at L25/4717 ("a"). **3/10 necessary.** The teacher circuit is the only one where an L0 embedding-level feature (L0/17) is individually necessary — suggesting the semantic role analogy relies on an early feature not redundantly encoded by later layers, unlike the capital analogies.

For `analog_bird` ("Fish is to water as bird is to" → air, p=0.117), ten features were tested and eight found necessary. **8/10 necessary.** This is the most fragile circuit in the dataset. Three L22 relay features (15670, 14727, 13619) are all independently necessary despite occupying the same layer, indicating they carry non-redundant information through parallel channels. This fragility is consistent with the circuit's very low prediction confidence (p=0.117).

Across all five circuits, necessity inversely correlates with prediction confidence: Berlin (p=0.973) yields 1/9; Rome (p=0.974) yields 4/10; Tokyo (p=0.990) yields 3/10; Teacher (p=0.486) yields 3/10; Bird (p=0.117) yields 8/10. Three features recur as necessary across multiple circuits: **L25/#286** (Rome, Tokyo, Cairo), **L25/#4717** (Rome, Teacher, Bird), and **L23/#13914** (Tokyo, Cairo).

#### 3.7.2 Full Backbone Suppression

Suppressing all late-layer backbone features simultaneously disrupted 6 of 7 circuits, as shown in Table 2. Failure modes are qualitatively informative: capital analogies degenerate to repetitive or archaic text ("of of of of of"; "pleaſure pleaſure plea"; "country country count"), indicating the backbone is required for entity selection while the prompt structure alone partially activates a "country" category. Teacher collapses to "1111"; bird falls through to generic continuation. Puppy→cat is the sole exception, apparently carried by direct embedding-to-logit connections outside the multi-hop backbone.

| Circuit          | p     | N feat. | Default Output     | Steered Output         | Disrupted? |

#### 3.7.3 Phase 1 and Phase 2 Feature Necessity

Individual suppression of 9 key phase features across all five prompts (45 tests total) reveals a clear asymmetry between Phase 1 and Phase 2. The results are shown in Table 3; cells show the steered first token when suppressed at strength −20, with "—" indicating an unchanged prediction.

| Feature     | Phase | Label                             | Berlin | Rome | Tokyo | Teacher   | Bird  |
| ----------- | ----- | --------------------------------- | ------ | ---- | ----- | --------- | ----- |
| L0/11651    | 1     | "the word 'to'"                   | Berlin | Rome | Tokyo | school    | water |
| L1/11356    | 1     | "'to' followed by a verb"         | —      | —    | —     | —         | —     |
| L4/10752    | 1     | "'to be' preceded by 'to'"        | —      | —    | —     | classroom | sky   |
| L5/9672     | 1     | "the phrase 'it is to'"           | —      | —    | —     | —         | sky   |
| **L5/5793** | **2** | **"analogies"**                   | —      | —    | —     | —         | —     |
| L5/2141     | 2     | "comparisons of public figures"   | —      | —    | —     | —         | —     |
| L8/13766    | 2     | "analogies or comparisons"        | —      | —    | —     | —         | fish  |
| L9/13344    | 2     | "comparison between two things"   | —      | —    | —     | —         | sky   |
| L13/10969   | 3     | "comparisons between disciplines" | —      | —    | —     | —         | —     |

*Table 3. Individual phase feature suppression across five circuits.*

Regarding Phase 1, L0/11651 is necessary in 4/5 circuits. Suppressing it causes capital analogies to predict the city name itself (Berlin, Rome, Tokyo), indicating the model reverts to the most recently mentioned entity rather than completing the analogy. For the bird circuit, suppression produces "water" (the source-pair element). Regarding Phase 2, L5/5793 ("analogies") is never individually necessary in any circuit — it is individually redundant for high-confidence circuits. For the fragile bird circuit (p=0.117), however, Phase 2 features become individually necessary: L8/13766 changes "air" to "fish" (source-domain animal); L9/13344 changes "air" to "sky." Regarding Phase 3, L13/10969 is not individually necessary for any circuit.

#### 3.7.4 Collective Phase Suppression

Collective suppression results are shown in Table 4, with all 20/20 cells disrupted.

| Experiment             | Features Suppressed                             | Berlin     | Rome       | Tokyo      | Teacher | Bird |

| All Phase 1 (5 feat.)  | L0/11651, L1/11356, L4/10752, L5/9672, L2/11475 | (empty)    | (empty)    | (empty)    | to      | to   |
| Phase 1+2 (9 feat.)    | All Phase 1 + Phase 2                           | :          | :          | :          | :       | :    |
| Phase 1+2+3 (10 feat.) | All Phase 1 + Phase 2 + L13/10969               | :          | :          | :          | be      | :    |

*Table 4. Collective phase suppression results.*

Phase 2 collective suppression is the most informative experiment in this paper. All three capital analogies output "France" — retaining the factual association "Paris is to France" but losing the relational transfer "as Berlin is to \_\_\_." This is direct causal evidence that Phase 2 features collectively implement the relational transfer operation. The failure mode is precisely what one would predict from the internal representation findings of Lee et al. [10], where reasoning failures reflect missing relational information in mid-upper layers. Phase 1 collective suppression produces empty outputs for capital analogies and "to" for semantic role analogies — a more severe failure, consistent with Phase 1 being a prerequisite for Phase 2. Combined Phase 1+2 suppression produces ":" for 4/5 circuits, consistent with the model defaulting to list-formatting punctuation when both template parsing and analogy recognition are disabled. These results establish a causal hierarchy — Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 + late layers — in which each phase is collectively necessary and earlier phases are prerequisites for later ones.

#### 3.7.5 Sufficiency (Hub Boost on Altered Prompts)

| Circuit          | Hub Boosted | Altered Prompt                          | Induced?          |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `analog_berlin`  | L21/4827    | "Cairo is to Egypt as Nairobi is to"    | no                |
| `analog_berlin`  | L21/4827    | "Madrid is to Spain as Berlin is to"    | **YES → Germany** |
| `analog_rome`    | L20/15360   | "Paris is to France as Tokyo is to"     | no                |
| `analog_rome`    | L20/15360   | "Madrid is to Spain as Rome is to"      | **YES → Italy**   |
| `analog_tokyo`   | L20/15360   | "Paris is to France as Rome is to"      | no                |
| `analog_tokyo`   | L20/15360   | "Beijing is to China as Tokyo is to"    | **YES → Japan**   |
| `analog_teacher` | L0/17       | "Nurse is to hospital as teacher is to" | no                |
| `analog_teacher` | L0/17       | "Doctor is to hospital as chef is to"   | no                |
| `analog_bird`    | L22/4252    | "Cat is to land as bird is to"          | no                |
| `analog_bird`    | L22/4252    | "Fish is to water as eagle is to"       | **YES → air**     |
| Cairo→Kenya      | L15/15954   | "Lagos is to Nigeria as Nairobi is to"  | **YES → Kenya**   |

5/11 tests succeed. Sufficiency holds when the altered prompt retains the target entity or a semantically close substitute, and fails when it crosses domain boundaries. The capital hubs encode domain-specific geographic associations rather than general-purpose "answer slot" activators.

#### 3.7.6 Specificity (Non-Backbone Feature Suppression)

| Circuit          | Feature  | Label                       | Steered Token | Disrupted? |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| `analog_berlin`  | L6/3335  | "difficulty/challenges"     | Germany       | no         |
| `analog_berlin`  | L13/4435 | "opera-related terms"       | Germany       | no         |
| `analog_rome`    | L6/2267  | "formal text/code"          | Italy         | no         |
| `analog_rome`    | L4/14857 | "code snippets"             | Italy         | no         |
| `analog_tokyo`   | L6/2267  | "formal text/code"          | Japan         | no         |
| `analog_tokyo`   | L3/10018 | early structural feature    | Japan         | no         |
| `analog_teacher` | L4/14857 | "code snippets"             | school        | no         |
| `analog_teacher` | L8/13766 | "analogies or comparisons"  | school        | no         |
| `analog_bird`    | L6/2267  | "formal text/code"          | **sky**       | YES        |
| `analog_bird`    | L5/5793  | "analogies"                 | air           | no         |
| Cairo→Kenya      | L5/5500  | "profanity and comparisons" | Kenya         | no         |
| Puppy→cat        | L9/2909  | "formulas/ratios"           | cat           | no         |

12/13 pass specificity. The sole exception — L6/2267 tipping bird from "air" to "sky" — occurs at the margin of unresolved token competition (p=0.117) and is confirmed inert for all high-confidence circuits. L5/5793 ("analogies") passes specificity for the bird circuit, consistent with it being individually dispensable but collectively necessary.

Across 159 steering experiments, five principal findings emerge. First, the late-layer backbone is collectively necessary: full backbone suppression disrupts 6/7 circuits. Second, individual necessity scales inversely with prediction confidence: high-confidence circuits have 1–4 necessary features while the lowest-confidence circuit has 8/10. Third, Phase 2 is collectively necessary but individually redundant: simultaneous suppression collapses every circuit, with capital analogies reverting to the source-pair answer ("France"). Fourth, Phase 1 circuit template features are individually necessary: L0/11651 alone disrupts 4/5 circuits. Fifth, formal-text features are causally inert: L4/#14857 and L6/#2267 do not affect any high-confidence prediction.

## 4. Discussion
Gemma-2-2B implements analogical reasoning through a stable, distributed circuit with a clear three-phase architecture — structural template parsing, analogy recognition, and relational integration — anchored by five features that activate consistently regardless of how the analogy is phrased. The collective suppression experiments show that the analogy recognition phase is causally necessary for relational transfer: remove it, and the model echoes the source-pair answer instead of completing the new one. The inverse relationship between prediction confidence and circuit fragility further suggests that well-learned associations are protected by redundant parallel causal paths, while low-confidence predictions rely on fragile non-redundant chains — a pattern that may reflect a general principle of how transformers allocate computational resources across tasks of varying difficulty.

## 5. Limitations

This study has five principal limitations. First, steering operates at the SAE feature level, not the attention head or residual stream level; the causal role of non-SAE circuit components is not assessed. Second, the `gemmascope-transcoder-16k` SAE [7] covers only cross-layer transcoder features; attention head contributions and residual stream features are not captured. Third, results are sensitive to node and edge thresholds (0.80/0.85): lower thresholds would reveal more features while higher thresholds would produce sparser, more focused circuits. Fourth, Neuronpedia [8] automated feature explanations are LLM-generated and may not perfectly capture feature semantics. Fifth, five prompts are sufficient for initial circuit identification but too few to claim statistical robustness; a larger prompt set covering arithmetic, cross-lingual, and abstract relational analogies [13] would strengthen conclusions.

Future work should pursue direct causal validation with TransformerLens activation patching at the attention head and residual stream level; expanded prompt sets; analysis across model scales (Gemma-2-9B, 27B); comparison with factual recall and multi-hop reasoning circuits; and testing whether the Phase 2 features generalize to the cross-lingual analogical settings studied in [14].

---

## 6. Conclusions

We have identified and characterized the analogical reasoning circuit in Gemma-2-2B using SAE attribution graphs from the Neuronpedia platform [8]. Across five initial prompts, 180 features — identified by stable (layer, feature index) pairs — appear in every attribution graph, forming the basis of the circuit. A further scaling experiment tested whether those features would survive 50 prompts phrased across four syntactically distinct surface forms; the circuit converged to a stable 67-feature core, with five features carrying explicitly analogical labels present across all 50 graphs. The circuit exhibits a three-phase architecture — structural template parsing (L0–L4), analogy recognition (L5–L9), and relational integration (L10–L13) — with activation magnitude increasing through each phase. Cross-domain generalization is confirmed: the same core features activate for both geographic and semantic role analogies, consistent with a domain-agnostic relational reasoning primitive. Phase 2 implements relational transfer collectively but not individually: simultaneous suppression collapses every circuit, with capital analogies reverting to the source-pair answer. Finally, circuit fragility tracks prediction confidence — high-confidence predictions route through redundant parallel causal paths while low-confidence predictions rely on fragile non-redundant chains.
